You decide! Just set the dial on your machine and off you go. I figure this would be set in a small English village so you could see everything back to the Middle Ages, even some of the Roman Empire, all the way back to neanderthals and beyond...\n\nPerhaps the object is to catch a criminal, like Carmen Sandiego. Or perhaps you've got to solve a mystery using procedurally-generated clues scattered throughout time. Maybe you'd just like to see what your great-great-grandparents were up to, or you're given mini-missions by various people taking advantage of your incredible machine.\n\nJust be careful: everything you do in the past affects the future \"in ways you can't imagine,\" as Abe Simpson would say. The open timeline is all plotted out, including thousands of generations of family histories and events, so changing something small can send bizarre ripples through history. And watch out that you don't meet yourself--that'll cause a rift in the space-time continuum, and everything will implode. Game over. Also don't do anything that would negate your own existence! Kill your grandfather? Game over.\n\nI figure this would have to be based on the Back to the Future-style time travel; that is, you can go back and change stuff, but it creates a new timeline every time you do (as opposed to closed-loop time travel as in Timecrimes or Predestination, which of course would be impossible here). The only thing is, if you were sent on a quest into the past and you changed something, when you went back to the future, the person who gave you the quest wouldn't have sent you on it...\n\nDetails, details. Make it happen, internet! I want to travel through time!\n\n[EDIT] Glad you like it! If you know any talented game makers out there tragically devoid of great game ideas, you know who to send them to...I'm handy with photoshop and conceptual stuff but coding is not my friend. I feel like if I could just get a proof of concept together, this thing'd be a shoe-in on Kickstarter.\n",

            "selftext": "Here's my idea. If you put in your regular password, your phone acts as usual, but it you put in a different password, it activates a \"guest mode\". guest mode could be either a locked down version of your phone, or a virtual machine. it doesn't even have to say that you're in guest mode\n\nIf your parent wants to get into your phone (or just wants the password so they can later), you can setup guest mode, and give them the password for that instead. \n\nGuest mode could have its settings changed from regular mode, dictating what apps are available. For native apps (camera, calls, texts, etc.) it could have a more in-depth censorship, like only showing calls or texts from whitelisted numbers, and hiding pictures on the camera roll.\n\nYou might even be able to have apps exclusive to guest mode. if you have a little sibling, nephew niece, or other child in your life, you might want to have games on guest mode.\n\nGuest mode could work in 2 ways. It could either be a locked down version, that still runs with your main phones OS, or it could run a virtual machine. in the case of it running a virtual machine, it could protect your \"real\" phone from viruses. if there's a risky website someone (or you) want to visit, you could open up guest mode, and then visit the website. if the website gives you a virus, you can simply reset guest mode, while keeping your \"real\" phone safe. \n\nOne of of issues I see with this, is it taking up valuable storage . although I don't have a specific solution to this, storage on phones has been increasing, and guest mode runs mostly with the software you already need for normal use.",

This would lead to less abandoned houses, and higher property value in neighborhoods. People like lotteries, and a 1 in 40,000 chance of winning is pretty good for a five dollar lottery. All profits made from lottery would go towards the reconstruction of houses. This would benefit the local economy a little, due to the construction. \n\nI think this lottery would become the preferred lottery for people, as all the winnings go towards the prize and each prize has a set amount of tickets that can be sold for it. So buyers would be playing against each other. You'd probably have to set restrictions on how many tickets a person can buy. You could also have the purchase of lottery tickets be through deduction from your paycheck, so the city could distribute the amount of tickets your allowed to buy based on income.",

It often has more pros than cons, and thats what we need to change.\n\nMost people would probably prefer a lesser punishment for lesser lies or none at all for some. Personally, I advocate an instant death penalty for even the smallest lie of a politician, going forward, and if someone does not agree to that they dont have to take the job. If they say they've never eaten at waffle house but its discovered they did eat there last week and seem to have a good memory about things they did weeks earlier, instant death penalty. But why? What harm could it do that they lie about where they eat? It gives other politicians and their followers a bad example, that anything less important than that, or slightly more important, is ok to to lie about too. So the line of what you can and cant lie about moves, and through distraction and control of large parts of the media, the line between what lies are and are not ok got to a very wrong place, that nearly anything a politician lies about is ok as long as they dont break another law while doing it. Including a few lies in every conversation is now the normal way to do politics. It wouldnt have happened if there was an instant death penalty for a politician lieing about anything, nomatter how small, and we could work toward that by gradually increasing punishments, like if they lie about having eaten at waffle house they have to pay a $1 fine, and let the news get all over that, that they were caught lying as proven by paying the fine, and do whatever it takes to get the lies out of politics and have most people agree thats not an ok way to run things anymore.",

She needs to check if a noise is being made, a description of that noise, and its location. I can't seem to find anything like that.\n\nI realise that finding the location of a noise with only one microphone on a phone presents a problem, but it could at least tell you whether a noise is getting louder if you walk towards it.

            "selftext": "I often hear that to learn a language it's important to actually practice and 'see' other people speaking that language.\n\nIt could even be kinda like role playing. Say, I know only english and have never been to germany but I'm trying to learn german. The VR app starts up, you wake up in the bed and subtitles appear on the screen that you're supposed to say. Then maybe your wife wakes up beside you and you're supposed to say your dialogues that appear on the screen. You go to work, but stop at a coffee shop before continuing. Basically there'll be a bunch of opportunities to talk. Then maybe you have to present a report that you already have prepared earlier. This would be like reciting an essay or something in a realistic environment. Then you have to go to a party or something. Pretty much a 'german/italian/whatever life simulator' if you will.\n\nI would totally buy this.\n\nOn the technical side, I think something like those little wireless motion tracking dots could be stuck on a native speakers lips and they could be made to do the voiceovers for the 'game'. So that not only do we get the proper native way of speaking in that language but also how their mouth moves.\n\nTo judge how well the users are doing, it could have a machine learning algorithm. Like take a bunch of speeches or maybe even audio from german tv shows (for example), transcribe them and the algorithm can then learn to identify who's saying what and how accurately.

I'm thinking about a single website where every page is about a dead person, and the living can talk about what they did, who they knew, fun facts, and that kind of things. \n\nPotential issues and how to fix them: \n\n- There would be a clear separation between testimonies and known facts. The latter requiring proof and mod aproval. \n\n- The remaining family may forbid or request deletion of a loved one's page. They may not forbid other pages from mentioning  him/her (without links to a page, since it would not exist).\n\n- Close family MUST be warned if a page is created about someone.\n\n- While still alive, you can make a request to the mods that the website forbids a page about yourself after your death. You can also authorize it, does preventing your family from forbiding it after you die. \n\nNot sure about this one, I feel that there would be a lot of legal issues and controversies:\n\n- The descendants can reverse your decision or previous descendants decision on forbiding the page an X amount of years after the death (if you made the request) or the request (if the family made it). \n\nSorry about the english, here.\n\n\nEdit: My idea here is that society should do what is possible to prevent people from being completely forgotten by history.

It's basically an iPad with the titty wrist rest but the screen shows an anime girl with her tits out. You just need to plug it into your PC and the pad turns on.\n\nNow here's the kicker, it basically acts like Wallpaper Engine or Dropbox, you can upload different anime pictures and set them as your mouse pad background. With this feature, you can have your delicate hands rest on any type of titty you desire (butts are also an option for all the ass men out there).\n\nThere's also an option to quickly turn it off if your mother or significant other happens to walk into the room so you never need to explain any titty that is under your hand.\n\nSo that is my idea, I'll be taking any investments now.

It could even ask you for an emergency contact like a family member for it to send an alert to as well, as well as let you delete the video if you confirm it was a non-emergency in the end. \n\nThere may already be apps like this but I can't find any that go the whole 9 miles, and having it be built into existing emergency systems on phones would mean you don't even need a passcode to use it. In missing person cases often phones get taken and a 911 call or a locally saved video just isn't enough to help the person get found. \n\nIt's just silly to me that we have this tracking device/camera in our pockets but the \"emergency\" button just does what phones have always been able to do. If an update or app like this could bring even one person home safely it's worth every r/TIFU post that stems from people setting it off on accident and taking a bad video or freaking out their emergency contact.",

            "selftext": "**All evidence points to the trend: the older you are, the more likely you are to die from COVID 19.**\n\n*- The median death age in Italy is 81.*\n\n*- Infected children present little to no symptoms.*\n\n*- Healthy adults show mild symptoms with high rates of recovery.*\n\nFor the person of average age, getting Coronavirus amounts to effects similar to the flu, which many of us get yearly, stay home for recovery, then go back about our lives. Instead of stopping everything, let's just go about our lives and keep the elderly quarantined to limit their risk of death. Seniors over 65 are often retired anyway and collect social security. Perhaps we could just expand the funding for those who need to work but are unable to do so. The rest of us may or may not get sick, but at least it's highly likely that we'll live to tell the tale. We should have probably had this policy for flu season regardless and maybe we can do so going forward. If it weren't for coronavirus, many of the elderly would've probably died from the flu anyway. The winter could be like a period of hibernation for the elderly and would help them live longer by minimizing their risks of illness during the colder seasons.\n\nI'm sure many of you will come up with nitpicky reasons for why this is not a good idea. For example:\n\n**- You can't force people to stay in quarantine.**\n\nMy response: You can't force the people who are currently in quarantine to stay where they are either. It's voluntary quarantine. Some people will listen and others will not. This will still minimize the overall death toll because many people will abide by it.\n\n**- It's not healthy for old people to stay inside.**\n\nMy response: True, social interaction is very important, especially at this age. However, a risk of death from lack of social interaction is much lower than the risk of stepping out and contracting the virus.\n\n\\- **It's not just the older people who are at risk.**\n\nMy response: I'm sure there are plenty of you who will fall back on this line of reasoning, completely ignoring the trends that I've mentioned above. Sure, it's possible that many non-elderly people will become infected, but we already run the risk going about society during flu season. Perhaps those who are at additional risk due to health problems despite being younger can apply for the benefits that would allow them to stay home, similar to how some disabled are allowed Medicare before 65.\n\nIn summary, this is not about curing the disease. Hopefully we will have a vaccine that makes this a moot point, but until then, the best way to limit deaths is to keep older people out of the line of fire.",

            "selftext": "I got this idea while playing RPG games. There's often a class or a function where the user can build items. \"Get 5 shells and 2 strings to make this thing\". When it gets very complicated and advanced, people will occasionally make entire websites dedicated to just tracking parts and what needs what to be built. (Like in Minecraft tutorials, for example)\n\n\nMy idea is something similar, but applied to the real world. There could be a website database (publicly open, like wikipedia) that keeps track of parts used in household (or bigger) objects. \"These parts are used for this coffee machine\", \"This specific motorcycle uses these parts\", \"This computer is build with these parts\". \n\n\nFor people that are interested in salvaging parts, or building things at home, this would be an absolute treasure trove for ideas and knowledge.\n\n\nThe added bonus of knowing where the parts came *from*, as well, may help give better perspective on humanitarian work. Knowing that something came from some offshore-factory that abuses its workers might give someone incentive to \"vote with their money\" as it were, and decide to invest in an alternative, better company. (If there is one. Making these things transparent would give incentive to create better alternatives, too.)\n\n\nIf all else, I would be curious to see of all the things I could create with a box and some springs.\n\n\nIf I had the time, the knowledge and the means, I would build this website myself. At the moment, I hold minimal design knowledge, unfortunately. But I really don't want this idea to disappear, I think it would be a great contribution for open and free information available to all.\n\n\nThoughts?",

You could meet up with your neighbors to trade fruits and the seeds of your best trees (some people may grow as many as 5 or something)      \n                \nFruit trees may require more water than most trees. Why not use the ones that are the most water efficient whilst cutting down enough non-fruit bearing trees and killing enough grass to make the water levels break even? Besides, a comparable amount of water would be used up somewhere on some farm to produce the same fruit.            \n               \nThis would allow farmers to focus their attention on things that we can't do in our front yard.

            "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Pick shows/episodes and movies you want to watch, the service puts them in blocks and schedules. Like a regular TV channel, but made for you. You tune in and it automatically plays whatever is scheduled for that time on the streaming platform of your choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVery weird, I know. Specially coming from a cord-cutter, who has not watched TV in \\~8 years.\n\nNowadays, I use streaming services exclusively. But *I actually miss* skipping episodes, watching them out of order, catching an episode halfway through, setting an alarm to catch them... And the demand for features like a random episode button for streaming services shows there are others who miss some of this too.\n\nI think it would be great for less serious and more episodic stuff like procedural dramas, sit-coms and cartoons. I feel like shows and movies have become much more serious for me. It's always a big event. For serialized shows/movies, you could make it only play the next unwatched episode; that way you don't have to worry about skipping any.\n\nThere's stuff on my list that I'll probably never watch, not because they're bad or because I don't want to watch them, but because I don't find a moment to do it. This would almost \"force\" me to try them, instead of watching the same kinds of things. And if I don't want to watch what's airing, I can always just turn on the VOD mode.\n\nIt would also be a time-saver and brainpower saver when you just tune in and watch something, anything, but don't want to have to choose what to watch.\n\nMaybe it could even integrate with cable and automatically play the shows and live events you like to watch when it airs. One single channel with everything you like (basically automatically switching between channels).\n\nIt could also bring some fun routine to life. I've been missing that after 5 months at home due to the pandemic.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if there was already a Kodi add-on for it, but I couldn't find any with a quick search.",

I think we can borrow from the \"Hazard Diamond\" in creating a new, clearer, more informative rating system for films.  \n  \nhttps://riskmanagement.unt.edu/riskman/Images/hazardDiamond.jpg - Hazard Diamond  \n  \nWhat I'd like to see is a pentagon-shaped shield displaying a 1-5 rating (5 being the most intense content) for the following five content categories: Violence & Gore, Substance Abuse, Sex & Nudity, Profanity, and Adult Themes. They'd be color-coded for easy at-a-glance reference, and totaled in the center to provide an easy 1-25 rating of the overall level of adult content. This would remove some (unfortunately not all) rating biases and put decision-making in the hands of the parents. As far as restricting children, just put a ban on young children from buying/seeing anything with a 3 or higher in one category, and teenagers under 17 from seeing anything with a 4 or higher. A rating of 5 would be reserved for the most extreme cases of splatter films, 300 F-bomb curse-fests, and softcore pornography.  \n  \nhttp://imgur.com/8GPyN4Z - Rate-agon  \n  \nOf course I know this'll never happen, but wouldn't it be nice to know more about the content up front and be able to make an informed decision, rather than being scared out of or shamed into seeing something?",

It would be most useful for difficult sounds (think of guttural Scandinavian sounds, Chinese, etc.)\n\nThe greedy goal would be to make videos appropriate for use in classrooms.  In Asia alone this would be a huge volume of views.  The \u2018nice\u2019 goal would be to lessen the financial burden on families who spend money on private language lessons (there\u2019s enormous pressure on kids in Asia to do well on English tests).\n\nI got this idea after watching a short video by Thomas Schwenke where he explains the inner mechanical functioning of an AK-47 rifle.  https://youtu.be/ZyajvvsuGcU\n\nI thought, ok, instead of gunpowder gases and firing pins, why not show how your teeth, tongue, and lips move as you make different sounds.  You\u2019d also show the flow of air and even whether the vocal chords should vibrate.  \n\nYou could rig up a mouth motion capture gizmo if it\u2019s unclear how the mouth moves for difficult sounds.  \n\nDetails to make it usable in classrooms:\n\nThe advertisement should never be the video type, only the banners near the bottom.  \n\nIdeally the video should be self explanatory without the need for narration (think Primitive Technology style).\n\nAlso there should be playlists for each pair of languages so menu and voice/caption instructions match the learners (Japanese people learning English, Russians learning Chinese..). Or there could be separate channels to simplify things.  \n\nThe student or teacher should be able to choose different types of videos.  Videos with voiced instructions or captions only; repeated repetitions or useful series of sounds or words (TH sounds, soft or hard vowels, R vs L, etc.), very slow or normal speed.\n\nThe channel name should be simple so it\u2019s easy to share.  For example \u2018English4U\u2019, \u2018German4U\u2019.  \n\nMany channels teaching English (and other languages) already exist but none use advanced animations to show how to enunciate.  It\u2019s just \u2018copy my sound!\u2019.  Or instructions in English telling you how to make the sound (but the student doesn\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying...).\n\nAnyhoo, I thought this was a neat idea.  \n\nPreemptive edit:  yes, I am sad and yes, I\u2019m in Japan.

Probably one of the best-known businessmen of all times.\n- He's richer than Trump (or at least, was, before he donated most of his wealth away). As a matter of fact, he was the richest person on the planet for a long time. How's that for successful?\n- According to people who worked with him, he's extremely hard working.\n- He's a very likeable person. He's done 3 AMAs on reddit already (/u/thisisbillgates/submitted/). He has dedicated most of his life (after quitting Microsoft) to philanthropy and educating the world. Leaving him with a very positive public image.\n- He seems to truly care about the world, and this would be a perfect opportunity to make an even bigger change than he could before.\n- He's a very intelligent person. He posts really insightful stuff on his [blog](https://www.gatesnotes.com/) about economic development and poverty. I'd say he's pretty much the opposite of Trump and any other politician who paints everything black and white and responds to everything with one-sentence soundbites. Yes, I have to be cynical here and say that he'd need to have some good one-sentence soundbites too if he wants to be popular, but it's nothing he can't do.\n- He's 60. Which is a decade younger than all current candidates!\n\nHonestly I think he could have wiped the floor with the current candidates if he had run this cycle.\n\nI wanted to propose Elon Musk as Vice President, but he's not American so he probably couldn't legally run.",

Like for example an asteroid hit the earth and most of human life is gone. The earth is mostly destroyed and the ecosystem suffered hard. Most plants and animals are gone and it's very hard to survive. The sky is black because of the impact and almost no sunlight hits the earth surface.\n\nNow there is a group of people fighting through the daily struggle of surviving the apocalypse. They meet a group of people who are better organized and structured. They have enough weapons, food and shelter. Of course there are the genre typical characters like a helpless but smart scientist and a Rambo-type and stuff.\n\nThere mission is not only to survive but to get to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault on Spitzbergen to restore the ecosystem of earth and to rebuild society. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounded a bit better in my head but maybe at least someone in Bollywood likes this idea.",

            "selftext": "Just saw a story that said that Apple might be ditching the lightning connector after the iPhone 12. Not in favor or USB-C, but instead to go completely portless. Keep in mind that wireless charging is less power efficient, slower, and actually gives you less mobility and ability to use your phone while charging it. It will have a smart connector for when wireless charging isn\u2019t available, but that means getting special adapters just to charge the iPhone that don\u2019t transmit data. The smart connector also charges slower than even the current lightning connector. It\u2019s a step down. It seems like Apple is increasingly designing its phones for home/office settings where large size is less important, power is easy to come by, and you have adapters or wireless charge pads waiting for you. \n\nI think they should release a rugged model iPhone. It has a smaller screen, a larger battery, a USB-C port for quick charging and device compatibility, and better impact and water resistance. It might need to sacrifice some newer camera features to keep the overall size down. It would probably be somewhere near iPhone 6 dimensions: a bit smaller in height and width and a little thicker than most modern iPhones.The combination of the reduced screen, larger battery, and modern component efficiency would make it far better in terms of battery life than other iPhones. The USB-C would make it fast and easy to charge especially if you\u2019re using a reserve battery pack and would make it compatible with most accessories. The smaller size would make it a better fit for a pocket and the extra thickness wouldn\u2019t be that consequential. \n\nThe battery life is the single most important factor. Waterproofing and USB-C next. This is because they require bulky cases or adapters to achieve. Impact resistance is the least important as it can be achieved with a case that\u2019s fairly thin. \n\n\nAs someone who wants the ability to stay in the Apple ecosystem, but doesn\u2019t need a phablet with 12 cameras and likes to work in a shop, go hiking, go to the beach, etc, without carrying around specialized charging equipment or a bulky case this phone would be ideal for me.\n\nI don\u2019t think most people are really worried about Apple shaving 1mm of thickness, especially when it means that you have to put a 2 mm case on the phone to protect the protruding camera module they couldn\u2019t shrink down enough. Essentially I\u2019d prefer they just fill up that extra space with battery.",

In this idea, you don't post a photo of yourself with an awkward bio and then go scrolling through profiles and have people just looking at what pictures are most attractive. Instead, you post dates/outings. You state an idea of what you want to do and when, a brief description of yourself and who you're looking to join, and which party should pay or split the bill. For example, 20M, looking for group of young adults, Dayton convention center, comicon,  Saturday March 14, split the bill. Or another example, 30M, looking for 25-31F, Art Museum, this Friday 4pm, I pay. Then users go scrolling through these open invitations to meet up on deliberate blind dates. Conversations start about pre-established shared interests and there is never awkwardness over the check or the struggle to figure out a good first date because these are people that want the same experience. The site would have its own free messenger app so that users can text without needing to share their phone number before meeting.\n\nI have seen that there are some dating apps out there that don't immediately reveal profile pictures, but they still have the same basic structure. My idea is to work backwards, starting with an idea of what you want to do, and ending with choosing who you want to join you.\nIt probably isn't a big money idea, but I think it would be good for the introverts that are uncomfortable with the traditional model of dating apps.",

The problem with this would be that it would require a literal dictionary for the language to accompany the book. This is why I have decided that it would work best on some kind of e-reader, which can easily store the dictionary, or if you come across a word that you might normally look, you could just tap or highlight the word, and it could easily display the definition and/or translation (in the language which you already speak).\n\nFinally, at first, I thought that this would be very impractical, as it would require a writer who fluently spoke at least 2 languages, but I have since realised that you only need someone who is fluent in 2 languages to translate parts of the book. \n",

It's about getting people back to work with money in hand more than hoping jobs magically appear out of austerity and corporate tax breaks.\n\nStarting in 10 years, every 2-4 years, a round of games bringing a steady influx of tourists, corporate money, and athletes and all their representative countries spending. \n\n\nPresently, the Olympics are having a hard time finding new locations for the games because they have a large up-front investment and then barely break even over the course of the single season of a game, while the stadiums and new hotels find little use afterward. Most of the jobs are temporary with little options for advancement or a new job after the games.\n\n If the games were a constant part of the local economy, there would be little fluctuation and a more steady flow of income over the long-term. The construction workers could move into the service and infrastructure management jobs they helped build, permanently. \n\n\nPlus what a great incentive for tourists, to go see these modern games while seeing the stadiums of the ancient world. \n\n\nOkay, so how many ways is this idea flawed?

Having this hotline would definitely give people the chance to expand on their communication skills, find better techniques when trying to prove themselves \u201cworthy\u201d, and throw away their bad speaking habits? The interviewer could definitely give some great constructive criticism. \n\nP.S. if there happens to be something similar to this already, please let me know!

            "selftext": "Amazon is more rich than Walmart and doesn't deal with produce at all and I think that's a shame. World hunger and GMOs are considered 2 major issues in the world to many people and vertical farming could eliminate both fairly quickly. With fruits and vegetables grown in a building not a lab you could safely grow them without the need to worry about pests. You wouldn't have to worry about season as once imported, any fruit or vegetable from anywhere in the world could be locally grown, or at least grown somewhere in your state, because it's indoors pests can't eat the produce removing the need for pesticides, and finally they'd be modernizing the practice of farming using 21st century technology perhaps removing the stigma of being a farmhand and greatly reducing the level of physical labor required which in turn opens up the age range of applicants therefore creating more jobs for more people at home and abroad. And they could collaborate with just food and maybe even fast track lab grown meat which is just cultured protein and harmless possibly ending factory farming animals as much or all together. And with all that land freed we could expand our cites at a lower cost by building inward and no longer engaging in deforestation thus saving animals and trees and birds and bees which would mean no one could say Amazon isn't green. And if all the goes well and after like I dunno 3 or 4 years pass if Amazon actually sees this and starts rolling the ball if weed is federally legal (here in the US) maybe they could make room for a couple crops.....that way way it'd have tegrity. Being able to order a chicken salad and an ounce of weed off Amazon while helping saving the planet internationally would be a good future for me.",

All three of these Star Wars shows focus primarily on the \u201cgood guys\u201d of the Star Wars universe, with Clone Wars also focusing on the villains as well. \n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I love seeing good guys win, but I\u2019d love to see an show that has the Empire as the \u201cgood guys\u201d for once. \n\nThink about it. The Empire has a large military, and they aren\u2019t clones like the Clone wars. These are people with families, perhaps even they\u2019re own values and goals that don\u2019t match the Empire, but they joined anyway because they might\u2019ve had no other choice.\n\nThe book Lost Stars by Claudia Gray did a good job at doing this, as the two protagonists start off as part of the Empire, with dreams and hopes. And don\u2019t forget that before Alderaan, a lot of people loved the Empire. It wasn\u2019t until that point in time where people, besides those already rebelling, started doubting it. \n\nI know that Rebels and Resistance had characters who were part of the Empire/First Order, but they either started out on the good guys side or were being a double agent. Either way, I want a character who is fully on the Empire the entire time, and maybe at the end of the show they don\u2019t join the rebellion, but believe that neither side is correct in their beliefs, and simply feels lost among a great galactic conflict.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! I've posted this in a few other subreddits and people seem to dig it - this place felt fitting as well.   \n\n\nI've been really geeking out on finding problems that I think could be turned into meaningful businesses. I'm sharing all my ideas [here](https://www.brainstorms.io/) if you're interested. Here's what I've been thinking about lately -\n\n# Opportunities in Work From Home Perks\n\n\u201cLike many companies, we\u2019ve recently shifted to a completely remote company. One of the biggest problems we are now facing is shifting our company perks to this new WFH model. No longer are we catering lunch, offering all you can eat snacks, or utilizing our amazing office space.\u201d - *HR Manager at a funded tech company*\n\n**Market Background & Opportunity Size**\n\nEmployee perks have become a coveted hiring strategy for some industries - namely tech. So much so that some companies have started hiring employees solely responsible for making the company\u2019s employees happy and providing them with perks - like workplace coordinators.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way, there\u2019s been a recent shift towards companies offering some pretty sweet perks to get top talent - so it\u2019s a young industry. Currently, here are some employee favorites that are being cut due to the pandemic:\n\n1. On-site fitness studios or gym memberships\n2. On-site snacks and beverages\n3. Catered lunches\n4. Office spaces w/ phone booths and ergonomic office equipment\n5. Company outings and happy hours\n\nAfter looking through a number of articles and doing a bit of math, I\u2019m estimating that companies offering perks spend somewhere between $3,000 - $9,000/employee/year on these types of non-traditional perks. This doesn\u2019t include things like health, 401k, or time off benefits.\n\nThis year we\u2019ve seen companies like Twitter, Google, Facebook, and Shopify use the pandemic as an opportunity to accelerate the shift to remote work for their employees. But, this isn\u2019t just happening with large tech companies.\n\nWhile finding an exact number was tough, a study by Gartner estimated that of the 56% of US companies that can allow their employees to work remotely, 74% say that they are going to shift more employees to remote after the pandemic. Another study cites that by the end of 2021, 25-30% of workers will be considered remote. It may not come to you as a shock, but it looks like remote work is here to stay.\n\n**Major Players**\n\nWho\u2019s already helping companies manage and offer employee perks?\n\nZenefits\n\n* Founded in 2013\n* Roughly 500 employees\n* $583.6M raised\n\nGusto\n\n* Founded in 2009\n* Roughly 1,000 employees\n* $516.1M raised\n\nBamboo HR\n\n* Founded in 2008\n* Roughly 700 employees\n* Bootstrapped\n\n*Note: I know there are a lot more companies out there, but I\u2019m selecting just these three because they are market leaders. Additionally, all of these companies do more than just manage perks - they offer a suite of HR tools.*\n\n**The Opportunities**\n\nThere are a number of opportunities in this space, but I\u2019ll stay focused and call out the ones that I see as the best return for the time/energy investment.\n\nWith people shifting to remote, a lot of companies are having to rethink how they do perks. If you can offer relevant perks while making it easy for the company to manage, I think you\u2019ll have a winner. Here are a few ideas that I\u2019ve got -\n\n1. Delivery curated food boxes for employees to keep them fed during the days.\n2. Schedule or give a stipend for cleaning services to keep their home (and now workspace) tidy.\n3. Send a cocktail kit every Friday (or once a month) so the team can do a virtual happy hour.\n4. Offer a service that offers home-office make-overs. You can spruce up their living space to make it a video call friendly, or provide them with better equipment.\n5. Create an easy way to manage and order group lunch for everyone working from different destinations.\n\nThese are just some examples, albeit I think they\u2019re pretty good, that you could run with. There\u2019s a wealth of opportunity here.\n\n**Current Solutions**\n\nHere are some companies that are also trying to solve the perks problem.\n\n* Cherry\n   * Cherry offered a flexible perk program that allowed employees to choose perks that mattered most to them. They recently shut down and wrote a stellar [blog post](https://medium.com/@gillian_obrien/cherry-is-shutting-down-our-story-4f4a67a9b1e9) about why. While they didn\u2019t directly offer any of the services I mentioned above, I added them because I think this a model that you could emulate.\n* SnackMagic\n   * SnackMagic allows employees to curate a box filled with their favorite snacks that is delivered directly to them. It\u2019s unclear if you can set up recurring orders through their site, additionally, their branding could use some work but overall seems like a solid company.\n* DRNXMYTH\n   * DRNXMYTH is a pre-made alcoholic beverage company. They offer, among other things, a way for companies to send their employee's drinks. This makes for the perfect virtual happy hour.\n\n**How to Execute**\n\nMy favorite part about this idea is that I think you could hustle your way to $10k/mrr with relative ease. Since that\u2019s what I would do if I were pursuing this, that\u2019s the plan I\u2019ll talk about -\n\n* **Define Your Early Adopter:** Let\u2019s start by targeting HR Managers. Next, think about which HR Managers are already trying to solve this problem for their company. With that in mind, I\u2019d look at who\u2019s using interesting perks platforms (not just Gusto or Zenefits). My gut says a good place to start would be tech companies that recently closed a Series A - this likely means they are hiring and looking for ways to attract top talent. Pro tip: you might be able to reach out to the founders of Cherry to see the types of companies they sold to.\n* **Use LinkedIn for Prospecting**: Use tools like Dux-Soup and LinkedIn Sales Navigator to quickly start reaching out and testing marketing messaging. If you\u2019re not able to even get responses from people, this is a good indication that you may need to pivot the offer or the solution you\u2019re pitching.\n* **Build a Concierge MVP**: This basically means don\u2019t use a lot of tech to solve the problem, just do it manually to start. With this idea especially, you don\u2019t need any fancy code. Find a few suppliers for the product or service, package it up, manually handle the logistics, and send a nice report to the HR manager at the end. This would allow you to test market risk, product risk, and channel risk really quickly and at a relatively low cost.\n* **Start Small:** Once you\u2019ve got some traction, limit the number of companies and employees that you work with. Since this will likely be a logistics heavy operation, find 1-3 companies with 10-30 employees to run a pilot. This will give you an opportunity to easily work out the kinks and find the places where you can start to automate the process.\n\n**Challenges**\n\n1. **Logistics heavy**: This isn\u2019t as straightforward as a typical SaaS tool. There are many moving parts which means it\u2019ll be a bigger headache to manage. This is a solvable problem, but it\u2019ll take more leg work to get everything worked out.\n2. **Is this just a \u201cnice to have\u201d?** With everything that\u2019s going on in the world, there are likely problems that will take priority over something like this. While there is a problem here, it may not be large enough to get companies to take action on a potential solution. I\u2019d focus on getting an answer to this question as soon as possible.\n3. **Low defensibility:** Part of the beauty of this idea is how easy it is to start up. But, that is also true for anyone that wants to compete in this space. This may not be an issue if you want to build a smaller lifestyle company.\n\nIf you have any questions - I'll be hanging out in the comments for a while!\n\nThanks for reading - now get out there and build it.",

            "selftext": "Daydreaming at a pub, I had a funny thought - I was recollecting about the #wastetheirtime2016 fad from earlier in the year, and had a crazy idea. How funny would it be to put 30 fake marijuana plants out behind your house, have the cops go full-on raid, only to find out they were silk the whole time? #wastetheirtime2016!\n\nAnd then I thought - what if every person who wanted legalization in a major prohibition state (like Kansas) was putting one in their window? A few in their garden? A hundred in a hidden spot that could only be seen by plane?  Imagine how law enforcement would have to change their approach to handling marijuana - They would be forced to prioritize major illegal grows instead of ANYONE with a pot plant.\n\nI am thinking about starting a fundraiser specifically to get these faux plants manufactured. Turns out, fake marijuana plants aren't easy to come by - because nobody is making them! There is ONE realistic plant for sale that I could find, but it sells for over $100. My goal is to buy in bulk so that the plants can be affordable for those who want to protest prohibition WITHOUT risking a criminal charge or breaking the bank.\n\nWhy fake plants? They take no time, resources, or maintenance, and there is no law that says you can't own a fake plant! I want to make this a low cost method of protest, and easily available to all. \n\nRight now I'm just trying to figure out how to even get custom silk plants made - \n\nSo what do you guys think? Please help talk myself out of pursuing this. \n\n\nEdit: I started an indiegogo. Until I can get more information, this is all I can do for now. https://igg.me/at/382BsgiDFCA",

            "selftext": "[\"Missed connections\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missed_connection) refers to a type of internet phenomenon where it becomes possible to get in contact with a complete stranger who you earlier noticed and were attracted to at a particular place and time by making a post on a forum (like craigslist) describing that individual and hoping that they will, by chance, stumble upon your post.  Of course it never works because very few people actually browse craigslist, let alone the missed connections section of craigslist.  \n\nMatch.com now has a missed connections feature, but it only works for people who have an account on match.com and enroll into the service, and it's not exactly for \"missed connections\" because it just tells you what other match.com members were in a particular area at the same time you were, regardless of whether you noticed them or not.\n\nWhat I was thinking for facebook would work like this:  You have a missed connection (you notice someone attractive but for whatever reason are unable to approach them in person), and once you realize the opportunity has passed you note the location and exact time you saw this person.  Because so many people have facebook accounts and have the app on their phone, there's a fair chance they have the app running, making it possible for facebook to store their location history.  So you describe to facebook the exact time and place of the missed connection, as well as the sex of the person, hair color, height, weight, etc. (even if they don't provide some of this info, facebook's algorithms can probably still detect it from analyzing photos). Facebook then determines if there is any match between its members and the info you provide and also verifies that you were actually in the same location at the same time, and if there is a match it sends a message to that person with a link to your profile.  If the person is interested they can then contact you back.  If they aren't interested then you will never know whether facebook identified your missed connection or not.  \n\nIt would protect privacy and at the same time become the first service that actually connects people who had missed connections.",
