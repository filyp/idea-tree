Almost all genealogy software uses the standard GEDCOM database format, so I think the data import would be fairly easy - you are just parsing a text file.\n\nA second iteration could have some research functionality or family tree linking.\n\nEDIT:  I should mention that I currently use PAF (via familysearch.org - thank you Mormons), and I've looked at Ancestry.com (too spendy) and geni.com (GEDCOM importing requires $$$ and is kludgey).  Family.Show looks to be the closest to what I'm envisioning, but after trying it I see a couple of limitations:\n\n1. GEDCOM importing partially failed for me.  I had to manually link a number of parents / kids, change a few genders, and it didn't recognize any middle names.\n\n2. I can't seem to get it to show more than a couple generations back at a time.  Maybe a display or memory limitation, I dunno, but I have records going back 30+ generations and thought it'd be cool to see the whole tree at once.",

If you don't water a plant, it begins to wilt until you start watering it again.\n\nTook a walk? Tap your plant named \"Walk\", which you have set to require water at least three times a week. Spent time learning guitar? Tap your \"guitar\" plant, since you've planned to practice weekly!\n\nYou just choose a name for your plant, set the watering requirements and start! Watering frequency variants: Daily, weekly, monthly and yearly with individually definable amount. In the future, there could also be different plant sizes, which represent which priority your particular thing has.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 Google Play:** [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.pineappleapps.cultivate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.pineappleapps.cultivate)\n\nThe app is free and does not require any special permissions.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Feedback is appreciated!

            "selftext": "Did you ever ask yourself why your textbook can feel so boring, especially when it comes to vocabulary? I did, a lot, especially when I was preparing to my German C1 exam. It was so hard to motivate myself to learn new words, that I ~~procrastinated~~ made an extension called VocabBoost to combine improving my vocabulary and browsing interesting stuff.\n\nThe approach is the following:\n\n1. Open an interesting page in your target language.\n2. Select some text.\n3. Right click with your mouse and choose VocabBoost > Make a test.\n4. The extension replaces some words with gaps ([example screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/NX3IUtV.png)).\n5. Read the text, fill in the gaps. Obviously just typing random words out of the blue can be overwhelming, so there is a mode to drag&drop words from a list into the correct places.\n\nThe extension is 100% free and even ad-free, because I want everyone to have equitable access to learning resources:\n\n* [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vocabboost/obgbcamdmcdcenchjmhggocjabmnnaab)\n* [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vocabboost/) \n\nI am pretty sure you are wondering which languages this supports. Literally all which use spaces&punctuation to separate words (the list is huge and involves rare and artificial languages) + Japanese (was requested a lot, so I had to ~~procrastinate~~ implement special support for it).\n\nOverall I've spent 61 hours developing this extension. Do you know what fuels me when I improve the extension? ~~Procrastination~~ Your feedback! I've even made [r/VocabBoost](https://www.reddit.com/r/VocabBoost/) subreddit just for that. This is also a nice way to learn about new features.",

However I'm thinking this process can be even more automated. It should work based on a person's phone usage. I can't think of any possible positive scenario where a person doesn't access their phone for let's say two weeks (or a month to be cautious.)\n\nIf the app doesn't detect phone usage during this time on the linked android or IOS accounts, it can reasonably assume that something happened to the owner and begin the assigned processes. I'm thinking these tasks can be stuff like shutting down accounts, consolidating finances, sharing information with loved ones, etc",

Most seem to be focused on big-name bestsellers or classics and its hard to find a group with my niche interests. My idea for an app is:\n\nYou get a profile where you get to make a \"want-to-read\" list of books. Maybe it is capped at a certain number of books, maybe not. Once a book gets enough people who want to read it (maybe 10?), the app sends a message to everyone who wants to read it asking them to opt into committing to book club around that particular title. Maybe it gives people X days to respond, or moves ahead once X minimum number of people agree. Then a chat or forum is created for the group and everyone can be connected to set up a reading / discussion schedule, maybe with some guided prompts from the app. \n\nIt would be a per-book kind of book club, so the group you're with would always change, but you'd always be reading something you actually want to read, not someone elses' boring pick-of-the-month.",

            "selftext": "Allow me to explain:\n\nNormally you play a game and the protagonist you're using starts off with nothing. Over time he gets more and more powers and abilities and becomes stronger. Paradoxically, the game gets harder, adding newer, stronger enemies or harder levels and plenty of other things. \n\nI would like to take this formula and turn it on it's head. First, I will talk about the story implement.\n\nLet's say the protagonist is a nearly indestructible hero who saves the galaxy from threats and he is loved and respected everywhere, and let's stay the story has a tragic tone that is reflected in the gameplay (The player feels weaker and challenged over time). \n\nThis superhero of sorts has all the powers you can think of: Superspeed, superstrength, energy blasts, flight, telekinesis, barriers, etc. whatever. \n\nBut then, one day, he starts losing his powers. Maybe he fell for a trap, he made a mistake, or one of his powers gradually vanishes over the course of time. He is weaker. People lose faith in him, enemies wreak more havoc, and he needs to win the people's faith and thwart the enemies' plans, even if he is losing his powers. \n\nNow I will add the gameplay element, which is pretty interesting. \n\nYou, as a player, are tossed into a battle and initially you smash through your enemies, not giving a damn because you're pretty much unbeatable. You don't even blink at the sight of an enemy and take them for granted because they are not a threat to you. \n\nHowever, you begin losing your powers. The same enemies you obliterated seem more of a challenge to you now. You must be more inventive. You need to pay attention to your enemies and see what they do in order to figure out their weak spots. As your powers keep dwindling to nothing, you're just like everyone else now (You have to use a gun, for example.) and it's very degrading and stressful. But at the same time, you must think your way out of a situation to see how you'll save the galaxy.\n\nBasically, it's a transition from Attrition Warfare to Maneuver Warfare.\n\nOn a cheery note, since you're pretty much a regular guy, people get motivated because they now they can do it too, so an army of regular people amasses and they stand up to fight the bad guys and win, with you leading the charge and being remembered as a hero among men.\n\nAlso: To counteract the fact that you're losing your powers (It kinda sucks you'll never use them again) there is an arena mode, where you fight wave after wave of enemies with whatever powers you want equipped...or gun if that's what you want.  \n\nEDIT: Arena mode unlocks when you beat the game. I also think story mode has replayability because it makes the player want to start over so he can use those cool powers.\n\n\n",

You'd need some sort of heuristic to avoid removing lame words like \"the\", \"a\", \"of\", etc. Perhaps the heuristic could simply be to select the article name as the word itself. An example of this would be: \"FILL IN THE BLANK: _________ is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915.\"\n\nSince pages in Wikipedia are categorized, the player can optionally say that she only wants questions about astronomy, or only questions about simpsons characters, or whatever other categories Wikipedia has defined.\n\nIf you guys have any ideas for other templates for generating questions, please post them here!",

You can find the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/msmx9v/vounty_create_and_fund_virtual_bounties_for/). If you would like to know more, there's also the [How It Works](https://vounty.io/) page, that explains everything in a few sentences.\n\nIt's very bare bones right now, but completely functional. Do expect to find a bug or two though, and when you do, please let me know. My objective is to see if there's interest in this project, and then work on improving the platform with your feedback.\n\nWith that in mind, I'd like to encourage everyone to start creating vounties. I will be contributing 5\u20ac to every vounty created in the following days. Also, if you would like to start a new vounty, but don't have the means to contribute the first mandatory 5\u20ac, reach out and we'll see what we can do.\n\nCheers!\n\nEdit: We have a subreddit now [r/Vounty](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vounty) ",

I am not sure if any API's exist that offer such functionality though.\n\nEdit 2: it appears Skyscanner offers an API for flights, hotels and car services which would be useful",

The idea is that with time Houston becomes a repository of great business opportunities for entrepreneurs that are not sure where to start or don't have a great idea that they're passionate about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why did you do this?** I created Houston because as a future entrepreneur I've personally struggled with finding good problems to solve. I keep hearing that you need to solve a problem that you yourself have but frankly after thinking long and hard I haven't really being able to come with an idea that I think can one day become a great company. Ironically this motivated me to create Houston.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Sign up*** and submit your own problems via Twitter with the hashtag #HoustonWHAP or by [email](mailto:houston@substack.com) to get featured in next week's newsletter! Let me know if you have any questions(:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.: I am calling this project Houston as in \"Houston, we have a problem\". I thought it was clever\n\n \u00af\\\\*(\u30c4)*/\u00af",

If a couple finds a cool spot to watch the sunset they could add a marker on the map for others to see and caption it with the option to add pictures as well. When uploading you can pick a category and optional \"price range\" to make it easier to find when others are sorting through location.\n\nYou could choose between seeing everything on the map or a list of everything organized by how close they are. I was inspired by the live updates in the Waze navigation app and thought it would be a really cool concept for an app for date night ideas.\n\nI found a similar app called DateNite but I could not find any other apps where live updates and reviews from other couples come into play.

You cannot currently \"zoom out\" to get a (lossy but antialiased) view of the whole 1280x960 desktop on your 1024x768 monitor.\n\nI understand that \"zooming out\" in a lossy way obviously isn't ideal, and smaller fonts in particular will quickly become unreadable -- but especially for netbooks with limited resolution screens, this might enable the user to run a higher-resolution desktop and applications that otherwise don't work well on small screens.",

            "selftext": "Merit Based Digital Game Store\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, a publisher submits their game, and people can buy that game... for a dollar,... no matter what it would cost anywhere else. Once you buy it, and play it, you can give it a simple thumbs up, or down, raising that game's score. The higher the game's score, the higher it's price, up to $100.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe weight of a player's vote is based on in-game achievements (not hours played), so you know they've actually played the game, and they can change that vote at any time, keeping that vote-weight. Voting will give them a dollar in in-store currency to purchase another new game. A player can legitimately pay a single dollar, and gain hundreds of brand new games, one after the other, over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA publisher can also set their goal price, putting a cap on it. Whether or not the game hit's it's goal, changes it's rank. If it doesn't hit, the game has no rank. If it hits, it ranks Copper. If it hit's the store cap of $100, it becomes Silver. If it's vote-score puts it at the store cap, but the publisher capped it at a lower price, it becomes Gold. All of this will effect the colour scheme of the game's info page, and it's search list entry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf a game's score is really bad, the publisher can wipe a small percentage of down-votes away every time they update the game, encouraging more consistent updates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe boon of all of this is players will be drawn to the first-come first-server dollar deals, and won't have a problem paying for a game they can afford at a higher price, knowing that it's been thoroughly vetted by their fellow players. Also, the platform will gain a ton of newer publishers who believe their game is worthy.",

            "selftext": "[SMT] a browser plugin that catalogs ads and reminds you before purchases how many specific retailers annoyed you with so you know exactly who to not purchase from.\n\nThere are retailers who annoy me to no end with their ads, I'm someone who understands the business model of ads, but really hates the abuse of them. Especially ads that are intrusive, try to fake me out, or just continue on repeat hundreds of times, and follow me around the internet. \n\nI know pi-hole exists. I'll use it for malware and other serious concerns. Here we might create a middle ground. Creators can make money. But companies that truly rely on pestering me will learn that they are losing money in the end. They might become trained to not use every psychological trick in the book. Just because we know about it, doesn't mean we need to employ it in every single ad served. They may choose better where to place their ads. Hopefully in a better middle ground. \n\n I don't want to spend my money with anyone that spend money on ads such as the pre-rolls on YouTube. C'mon i haven't even seen the content and you're shoving 2 6 second ads in my face. Or the ones that follow me up and down a page, or the ones that auto popup videos in my face, or one's that block content, or, or, or.... Sigh, just stop. Show ads, be nice, don't ruin the internet. Because you have.\n\nFor too long they have relied on our memories. Many simply choosing the idea that any coverage is good coverage in the long run, because we are human and fallible and won't remember they were dicks with shoving their ads down my throat. Using unique identifiers to follow me from site to site. Testing a/b's on me until i finally buy from them, and then repeating that ad nauseum (pun intended). Well, I want a way to fight back. One that doesn't nuke then from orbit. One that can help make sure I'll remember the assholes. Every time. And never spend a dime on them. They might learn over time and change their nasty ways. We can tip the scales back into the consumers court.\n\nI'd love a way to put my money where my mouth is and not purchase from these retailers. But with so many ads bombarding me all the time I only remember the really egregious ones. With a browser app that catalogues the ads that show up and helps me remember what I've seen this past month, year, or lifetime I'll know everything about where to spend my money. I'll never forget. We'll all never forget.\n\nIf it detects a checkout it would be nice to see some metrics popup for that retailer and the products in my cart. Maybe a search option to further drill down or when it's not recognizing a company because I'm on Amazon or ebay, or just what's in my cart. I want to know companies of products and retailers. \n\nOn top of the additional metrics, If i see an insane ad that's is driving me nuts, I'd like a way to manually trigger to a special category to remember them as someone to never ever give them my money even if their product affords me some great little life fix. And a way to manually add something. Perhaps if they screwed over a friend, disregard human life, or just have a low moral compass.\n\nBonus if it can track things not just as a browser extension but on the phone too, maybe similar to funnel everything through a vpn like adguard or pihole etc. Not sure what would work isolated on my phone and not open up privacy issues on someone else's servers. Anyways I use more time on my phone than on a PC nowadays so this would be more useful. \n\nBonus idea: destroy the text above any recipe. Just get rid of the div or something. Shudder.",

            "selftext": "Hello fellow Redditors!\n\nI like reading about ideas for all kinds of different apps and even though I forget most of them, I still like to keep a shortlist of ideas I think could help a lot of people and generate a lot of income.\n\nHere are some of them:\n\n**Handyman app** \\- There are a lot of posts and sites about making a handyman app, but I never managed to find a working app to see how it functions. But the idea seems too good to pass on, a lot of people are not equipped with the tools to fix and maintain an entire house or an apartment, just as a lot of people don\u2019t have cars and are using transport services. This could both save time and money for companies who are just waiting for people to call them. Just think about how simple the steps could be \u2013 you download an app, something breaks, you take a picture, send it over the app, the company sends their team to your house, they fix it, you pay it over the app, and all done. Of course, I am over-simplifying here, but you get the idea. It could even be set up as a subscription-based model, so you have \u2018\u2019free\u2019\u2019 repairs while you pay the sub.\n\n**On-demand-fuel-delivery app** \u2013 Imagine you run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. Alone, no idea where the next gas station is, and even if you do, you probably don\u2019t have your canister and have to buy it to fill it, and that\u2019s IF you find a gas station. Luckily, we have GPS nowadays and we know exactly where the gas station is. But what if you don\u2019t want to leave your car? What if it\u2019s the middle of the night and you have to walk at least half an hour to the nearest one? This app could be designed in a way that the user shares his GPS location and the type of fuel the vehicle uses. The team drives to your location and provides you with fuel. This could also be integrated in existing tow-truck service apps.\n\n**Mushroom identifier app** \u2013 Probably not the most popular idea out there, this app could potentially save lives. There are existing websites that offer community-based identification for plants and mushrooms, but what if we used Ai for it? What if we teach a machine to recognize poisonous ones and alerts us shortly after we take a picture? If you know about some existing apps like this, feel free to share!\n\n**Original or not app** (for clothing brands) \u2013 Ever bought some clothes that turned out to be fake? What if there was a way to identify the original brand from fake ones? Is it possible to create a database and fill it with barcodes or some other detail that is unique to the original product and visible to the consumer, so that we can use that database to scan the product to determine its originality? Never found much info on apps like this. If you did, let me know.\n\nWhat were your favorite app ideas that changed people's lives or helped you in any way? What ideas would you like to see made into reality?",

I'm either convinced I won't have time to do anything fun so I never plan anything, or I'm just so busy I don't think to plan something until the very moment a thick wave of loneliness starts to take over my soul. Usually when I start texting around to see if there's somebody out there who is also bored or if there's a group of people who might want me to hang out with them, I come up empty handed because everybody else seems to plan their lives out. Go figure?\n\nAnyways, I'm thinking the solution could be pretty simple. The app just connects Facebook friends, and there's only two statuses. \"not bored\" or \"bored.\" That way I can find everybody I could potentially hang out with, or they could find and save me from my own pathetic life. \n\nAm I the only one out there with this problem?

From a quick observation it seems to work faster than GIF Preloader and it's compatible outside of reddit.\n\n\n**EDIT 3:** As suggested in the comments. For firefox I'm using this [Greasmonkey script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/115421). Simply download the Firefox Add-on [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/?src=search) then go to the script and install.

More importantly  The database should be a mechanism to facilitate the creation of these things.   \n\nAs I said in the trig thread,  Most schools would have at least one teacher with some good ideas for what could be made into a good vidual representation.  If they can storyboard their ideas a programmer can implement the idea.  Most schools would have at least one parent of a pupil capable of doing some decent JavaScript and Canvas work.  That makes the very real possibility for people to pair up to make these things.  A website could use the home page of each school as a reasonable unique identifier for people affiliated with the same school find each other.  That's not to say people couldn't collaborate online however.  Another important part of this project would be a collaboration area where people could post storyboards and work on implementations.\n\nI think it's a good idea, and somebody really should make this.\n",

But, when spell memorization takes place, the user is given a Math problem equal to level of the spell he/she is trying to cast.  The world server would send the user the Math problem.  Then later in game time, when the user attempts to cast the spell, the user would be prompted to enter the answer to the Math problem.\nHigher levels of casting would require Higher levels of math skill.  Level 20 spells might require advanced calculus.\nLikewise we could do similar things with other classes.  A thief class try to open a lock would need to answer a history multiple choice question.  The higher the level of skill required the more complex the question.\nFighters could have questions regarding culture (meh) or maybe even basic skills questions.  \"What are the required fields to be filled out on an envelope?\" at a level one swing, to a level 5 swing which might be some advanced life skill...... \"What is the date that US Federal taxes are required to be filled by?\"\n\nBasically, I think that this could be created easily by a developer.  He/She could edit a common open source MMORPG engine and design the basics of the system.  Then create a plugin to a database engine and the format for questions on the world server.\nThen using something like SourceForge allow a small privileged community to compile the question/answer list.\n\nI think this would be a great game embraced by the educational community, parents and regular people.

Once new files are added, it could become illegal, but it's already in DHT and no longer require the search engines.\n\nThis could of course also be used by indie musicians, to distribute new songs, or my painters to distribute images of their paintings.\n\nOr even by linux distributions to send new versions.\n\nBut those are just legal applications.

But this idea is just too awesome to contain and I thought I should share.\n\nOkay, the app would be a Pokemon app that has the original 151 characters in it. Once you sign up, it will let you pick just one of the 3 original starter Pokemon (Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander). You can name your Pokemon and look at its stats, but that's pretty much it. As you walk around, however, you'll get little notifications saying that you just found a wild Pokemon and can go into battle with it, with the intent that you can capture it and add it to your repertoire. When you're at home, being there allows you to get more Pokeballs, heal your Pokemon, and look at all your Pokemon and switch them around. You can also manually initiate a battle with a friend who also has the app installed if they are in the vicinity of around 50 feet or something or if you know their phone number.\n\nAbout wild pokemon: It would start out with basic pokemon such as Caterpies, Rattatas, Pidgeys, etc... Also, depending on the region of the US you are in, as you get higher in levels you find different wild Pokemon to fight. Walking around large bodies of water and coastal cities leads to Magikarps or Seels. Walking in terrain deemed mountainous can lead to Geodudes and Machops. You can only find the super rare Articuno if you're in Alaska and extremely lucky.\n\nI am just imagining something nostalgic and simple that you can easily do as you walk around or are just sitting on a bus or in a cafe. Free app since we probably wouldn't be allowed to make money from Pokemon. Anyone want to take off and run with this?\n\n=====\n\nEdit:  Seems like the Android would be the best bet for this kind of app.  It has multitasking, and is a bit more liberal in allowing apps to go through.\n\nAlso, what if we treated each continent as a different \"region\" and had pokemon from the johto region in Europe, Hoenn, in Australia...so on and so forth.  Or we could just mix them all up and make it world wide....",

            "selftext": "So for example: You point your cameraphone at your bedroom.\n\nThen set the language mode to show labels for everything in the room in the language pair you the user decide on. For this example: English & German.\n\nIf the camera sees the bed, pillows and blanket, labels will pop up on top of them saying *BED/BETT, PILLOW/KISSEN, BLANKET/DECKE.*\n\nIf the camera sees a window, a label will pop up on top of the relevant features and say *WINDOW/FENSTER, VENETIAN BLIND/JALOUSIE, WINDOWSILL/FENSTERBANK*\n\nand you get the idea.\n\nIf the app's database doesn't know the words for an object it sees yet, users knowledgeable in their languages can submit a \"database update suggestion\" to the app developers and the developers will review them and add the correct suggestions to the database, to show up on the app in the next app update.\n\nYou should be able to adjust font, font color and font size.\n\nGoes without saying but the user needs to be able to take pictures with the labels showing up on the photos, and film videos with the labels showing up on the videos if they wish to snap or film through that app. Would make for some great language-instruction YouTube videos!\n\nOught to be appropriate for learners of all ages, so there may also be a kid's mode so that a kid-friendly interface would show up for any child needing to learn new words for new objects through this augmented reality app as well.\n\nThe *free* version needs to have ads. After all, how else does the dev studio for this app sustain itself, turn a profit and grow? But the ads will be specific to the products the app sees through the camera lens. \n\nFor example: when it looks at my Brother HL-2280DW printer, it will show the label \"BROTHER HL-2280DW PRINTER / BRUDER HL-2280DW DRUCKER\" with a bilingual ad under it saying something like \"Low on printer ink? Click here to buy a replacement toner cartridge compatible with the Brother HL-2280DW for only $39.95! Will have enough ink for 2,500 pages.\" / \"Niedriger Tintenstand? Klicken Sie hier, um eine Ersatztonerpatrone zu kaufen, die mit dem Bruder HL-2280DW kompatibel ist, f\u00fcr nur 39,95 US-Dollar! Reicht Tinte f\u00fcr 2.500 Seiten.\"\n\nAnd if it looks at a motor vehicle, it would suggest deals on replacement tires if it detects low treads / excessive tread wear, or a great bundle deal on a local oil change. Yeah, you get the idea.\n\nThen of course, if you pay for the premium version, ads will be turned off by default but you can turn them back on at anytime, particularly if you want to learn a new language through reading bilingual ads.\n\nThis whole app would also be very ideal for augmented reality headsets (like a Google Glass 2.0 if they ever improve upon the original, or an Oculus Rift or what have you.)",

The reason I believe a website like this is important is that it allows the user to get in contact with all of their U.S. representatives to ensure their voices are heard. \n\nUnlike other websites that makes the user type in their full address and only provides them with email, phone and address, this one will provide all of that, plus their social media accounts as those means of communication are more suitable to a wider population and make just as big an impact as sending a letter in the mail. The ease of access will allow citizens to have more influence on their elected representatives by establishing an easy to use channel of communicating with them.\n\nFrom a development stand point, building this website should not be too hard. There already exists a database that keeps track of the U.S. government representatives and their emails, phone number and addresses. (https://www.govtrack.us/developers) This database is updated on a regular basis. However, I do not believe that the representatives Facebook and Twitter accounts are maintained, so obtaining that information may require another solution.\n\nI envision this website being a .org website as a non-profit. This allows it to accept funds for building, operating and maintaining the site, which can be construed as salaries should that ever happen. Of course, any funds directed to the website will be evenly distributed with all those who contributed to the project. \n\nI can pay (or we can split) for the domain and webhosting. I can also create the overall project scope and requirements and help with the coding as I have a little bit of experience. Just need a web developer that can take care of the website.

The tasks could be purely casual game-like, using entirely different thought domain, or similar to the related real world behaviour;  \n- replayable, making the tasks interesting on the second and further playthroughs, this is somewhat important here as a single-run but memorable kind of game won't really work for that, as the point is to train habitual pattern;  \n- interactively use imagery and sounds, avoiding entirely text-based experience;  \n- using a portable backend, so it can be played on a multiple platforms;  \n\nI know that there is not much substance as to what kind of game(s) can those be so any suggestions are welcome.",

I feel like an app like this could make one of you some money but don't charge for the app. Just put ad banners. Please don't put ad pop-ups though. If you make this app free then people will tell their friends to download it so they can try more phones connected at the same time. Imagine having 5 or more iphones all playing the same song at the same time. That would be fun. Also a big part of the concept is to be able to play any audio that comes from the \"host\" phone. This means youtube, itunes, pandora, spotify, garageband, etc. Any audio.\nI'm curious if this app idea is impossible or if there are some major security concerns.

The last time I voted after insane amounts of google-foo, I still had only figured out their names and parties but not a clear list of their views. Bummer.\n\nSo there should be a app where folks can log in information about who is running for what, and where that matters to. Like wikipedia, individuals would also be able to report any false candidates or mis-information.\nThe idea is that you log in your zipcode and immediately see every office relating to you school district, county, city, state, and the federal offices that are up for grabs AND who is running for them as well as what their big views are. It could even list current office holders that aren't up for grabs in the coming elections, but list when their terms end. The app would give important dates to register by, how to absentee vote, and where the voting location is for that zipcode.\n\nAll of the information would be maintained by locals volunteering what they know and if it became successful enough, campaign offices would update the app instead of random locals. If something is reported enough, it would go to the administrators attention and they would then fact check it.\n\nIt's too hard to be an informed voter and it shouldn't be. It'd be nice if voting booths/locations gave out pamphlets expressing the views of those running, but they don't. This could work though but it would have to be big.",

            "selftext": "Hi all, I'm back with another app. This app is called Ungry, which allows you to scan an ingredient and return recipes that contain the particular ingredient. The app does have ads, nothing too intrusive, besides the one rewarded video you have to view prior to viewing a details/instructions of a recipe and there is **NO** subscription or purchase.  However, I cannot promise this will be the case in the future.\n\n[Ungry: Scan & Search Recipes](https://apps.apple.com/bm/app/ungry-scan-search-recipes/id1580290009)\n\nPersonally, I quite like the concept and future plans include the luxury of scanning multiple ingredients and finding recipes containing the ingredients, but right now, you can only scan/search by one ingredient and the items/ingredients which are supported are small.  Although I have included the most common ingredient in most recipes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*Why can't I scan multiple ingredients?* \n\nBecause I would require access to a database that would allow me to do so, however, this comes at a costly premium can range anywhere from $40-$60 per month, and in some cases well over $150+ and this is an MVP. So I hope you can understand, I'd like to allow users to adopt the concept (hopefully) and if people are willing to pay a subscription fee per month, to allow for more features and a wider range of recipes and ingredients, then you should see this in an update soon!\n\nTo anyone vegan it's hard to detect if an item is vegan friendly just by scanning the raw ingredient. So you most likely will struggle finding recipes which are applicable to you, and for that, I apologise. Maybe if enough interest is generated and I incorporate a better database, I'll 100% look out for one which allows me to search via dietary options!\n\nFeel free to download and try! No payment/subscription, no sign up! \n\nIf you like it vote it 5 stars, if you hate it vote it 1 star and ***TELL ME WHY?! (AINT NOTHING BUT A HEARTACHE)***\n\nAny and all feedback is welcome!",

Give players the ability to design the looks of the items so they have more agency to paint a picture of the story they\u2019re trying to create.\n\nGeocaching should mix its cache database with an RPG game. Maybe it would be a separate app. Make it so that players can create a customized character with certain abilities/skills, and then they can explore the real-life cache world, and when they find a cache, they are awarded with a weapon, a piece of armor, a magical scroll, or a written note that guides the player along a storyline created by the placer of the cache. The awards could either be: \n\n1. Randomized\n2. Higher value if more difficult to find\n3. Customizable by the person placing the cache, so they can write their own narrative/story by placing notes into the cache, which urges people who continue trying to find the caches\n\nThe caches themselves then could be made to look like treasure boxes, swords, scrolls, notes jewelry, etc. so it reflects the RPG nature of the game itself.\n\nThe game could then have their own NPCs created by the cache-placer who you can interact with on your way to finding the caches, as well as enemies who can either guard the caches, or are just scattered all over the land, so players either have to fight them or sneak around them.\n\nMaybe if active players are in proximity to each other, they could either form an alliance or fight each other. \n\nSo basically, it\u2019s like mixing Geocaching with Elder Scrolls/Skyrim and/or D&D. Use real-world objects and locations to create an open-world RPG that the cache-placers themselves can customize for the players!\n\nLots of potential here! And plus, you\u2019re going to attract an entirely new market of enthusiastic players who are into RPG/Dungeons and Dragons stuff. They will go crazy about this because they can use their own imagination and make the stories/caches really cool and interesting.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

A website that fulfills all the qualities that define life.\n\n* respond to their environment\n* grow and change\n* reproduce and have offspring\n* have a complex chemistry\n* maintain homeostasis\n* are built of structures called cells\n* pass their traits onto their offspring\n\nUsers click on the website, and are greeted with a white screen. *Hi. My name is Carl.* appears on the screen w/ voice reading. *Please don't kill me.* follows. \nFade to website.\nWebsite is an interactive blob named \"Carl\". Carl is made out of virtual hexagonal \"cells\" that wiggle periodically. Rolling your mouse over them makes the hexagons wiggle.\n\nRespond to their environment: Check.\nAre built of cells: Check.\n\nCarl is fed by visitors to the website. Each click on Carl drops a line segment into his mouth. We can see the line segment drift through his transparent hexagonal body, then click to the wall, to expand his body. Cells are built this way. The website is community focused, where everyone contributes to his growth. The number at the top displays how long until Carl dies without being fed. Carl grows by hitting an exponentially increasing ceiling with rewards for hitting sizes. *(basically community cookie clicker designed to pull people in but make them leave with a question about what life truly constitutes as.)* Carl gets things like tufts of hair, then acne, then later a mustache, a beard, and grows a bald spot. The major goal is Carl undergoes binary fission, which creates a second website, called Cynthia. Same function as previous website. Players can now grow whichever one they want. (Endgame will be an exponentially increasing goal list, that also increases his decay rate, insuring an inevitable destruction at some point.)\n\nGrow and change: Check.\nReproduce and have offspring: Check.\nPass their traits onto their offspring: Check.\n\nOther ideas: Carl will say things occasionally in background. \"Whooo-wee.\" \"Please keep feeding me.\" \"Am I truly alive?\" Perhaps as one of the goals, it unlocks an immunity game where players have to defend Carl from incoming bugs, by shooting them before they reach him, checking the homeostasis part. (they move really slowly and have massive health though)\n\nThe goal is to be a weird thought experiment, as well as being a game that's as interactive as possible, whether that's letting players who get the last click on a cell choose the color of the cell, building a massive crazy colored looking Carl, letting players choose choices in Carl's life, or whatever.\n\nHowever, one rule. **When Carl dies, he DIES.** The website just displays the stat's of Carl's life, with a red background. That's it. It has a link to a paragraph on why it was made/behind the scenes.\n\nTBH I really like this idea, and would like to figure out how to program it. Once that's done, I would make the next goal to share it with as much media as possible. (ie Wired, local news, further) If I was proficient in web design, I'd probably already be cranking it out. I will keep reddit updated, but would appreciate any help.\n\nCarl concept: https://imgur.com/LOd58D6",

            "selftext": "Hear me out. So, in the game you are the murderer. You can choose your victims. Let's say you can decide if you want to lure them to your home, break in to their home or kill them outside. You can pick up weapons from anywhere, or use your hands. Maybe there can be skill levels, so you'll be good at strangling or great in using guns. I don't know if there's a better idea to pick victims, maybe you can also interact with strangers on the street. Think of it as the Sims but with murder. Another idea is the option to move to a different town so you won't get caught.\n\nA little walkthrough: You start at your house. You might pick up a knife from your kitchen, and gloves and a mask from your closet. You can go through each room as if you're getting ready for your kill. You pick up your things and head out the door. You have a cellphone where you can pick your victim. Let's say you pick a friend from your contacts. You ask them to hang out. Head over to their place and get invited it. Or if you're not invited in you can break in, but for this you would have needed to get tools(Other options could include an open window). After your inside you can chat with your friend or just start killing them. With whatever you choose to use.\n\nAfter they're dead, or if you just attempted to if your skill levels aren't high enough, you will have other choices like to clean up evidence that could lead to you. You can also choose to take better weapons or tools from their homes, so you will have better luck in your next killings. All murder scenes will look different with the options you have chosen.\n\nIf you get caught by the police, the game will maybe have you be questioned by cops, the game will be over. You lose all your tools and skills.\n\nThis is all I have. The main goal of the game is to never get caught, and become the best serial killer ever. Is this a good idea? Sorry if there is something like this already. I'm also aware of Yandere Game Murder Sim, which I've never played. But this game would be much more realistic and have more options.",

If it stops (or drops below some threshold), it is not being held. Let me see a super simple time log.\n\nIt needs to remain active even while using other apps. That is the main potential complication I wonder about.\n\nUSE CASE: I think there may be several potential uses for this, but my personal goal is to know exactly when I put the phone down and go to sleep each night. (I'm tired and don't look at clock. Or I do look but forget what it was.)\n\nCOMPETITION: I know there are apps that log accelerometer and other sensor data. And there are sleep log apps designed for you to put your phone on your bed. But I just want this one simple thing: A log of when the phone being held or not.\n\nCOMPENSATION: I'll promote your app on KarmaDecay.com and GifSound.com for free. Or if you have another app you want promoted instead, I might agree.\n\n-----------\n\n**tl;dr: Want very simple app that uses phones motion sensor to keep a log of when phone is being held.**\n\nEDIT: Simply logging if the screen is active or not would probably also work to solve my particular need - if possible.

Each new artist signs a guestbook under the piece they worked on, listing their name and their contribution to the piece if they want credit for their work, or they can choose to remain anonymous. Once a canvas starts to run out of space for further modifications, they're pulled from commission and put on display behind glass, and a fresh print is put up for people to start modifying again from scratch. Once so many are made that the museum starts running out of space, older ones are photographed to be kept in a digital archive, and then auctioned off to make room for newer ones. Proceeds from the auctions go towards either running the museum itself, or towards supporting the arts in public schools or some similar worthwhile initiative. \n \nSomeone pleeeease make this a thing.

Think Katamari, but instead of picking up objects you smash them - and like Katamari, the stages get bigger and bigger.\n\nLet's say you're in a farmer's garden, having landed on earth cocooned in a rouge asteroid (the campaigns will each have the same tone and objectives, but differing circumstances, like Left 4 Dead but with more customization options) and you start eating his crops to gain strength, which makes your size increase, which makes you dish out more damage. Or, if crops aren't to your liking (if you chose to be a Mechanical Menace instead of a Biological Nightmare) you go for his farming tools or barbed wire fence - if you're a robot, you need metal, and if you're a living being, you need organic material.\n\nOnce you have grown to an appropriate size, you can begin to hunt the tasty humans - or tasty farm vehicles. Once the farm has been sufficiently destroyed, the next level begins.\n\nNow you're much bigger, able to see clear over the tree tops. You're on the outskirts of the small town the farmer's land was near. Time to go introduce yourself to society at large. By the end of this level, you will see a fair amount of combat through the townsfolk and the eventual arrival of the National Guard. You're big news now, buddy.\n\nNext up you see the city. You're about eye level with the skyscrapers, ready to chew them into dust. The army will start to hammer you here, and at the end of the level you will have to deal with another monster of your size. You leave the city a smoldering ruin.\n\nThe next level sees you at about a mile high, with every step the earth cracks beneath your feet. When you stomp at the ground, the plates shift. It is your duty to sink this continent into the ocean depths, where it belongs. Instead of eating to gain size in this map, you need to destroy enough so that the military uses nuclear deterrents, which in turn (and much to their dismay) make you grow even faster. Soon just the act of walking is enough to sink this hemisphere.\n\nIn the final level, you have the entire world's forces pummeling you from space. You must dodge their attacks, even going so far as to use the moon or chunks of the earth as cover. When you've gotten big enough, you give the earth one last \"fuck you\" and kick, throwing it off its orbit and plunging into the sun. As you fly off into space, you wink and give the camera a thumbs up.\n\nOther campaigns can run differently - Where you start in a Japanese fishing village, working your way up to Tokyo, or in a Russian research lab, longing to show the reds who's boss.\n\nHere are added elements to fill out the game:\n\nPlay Tone - There would be a tongue-in-cheek style of humor surrounding the game, if you want there to be. It all depends on how you play it. If you want your creature to dance while he commits genocide, then dance he shall, and the news coverage will reflect these choices.\n\nLoading screens - In between levels there would have to be loading screens, as I don't think any engine could support a game world this large while maintaining an insane amount of detail. A TV with color bars would feature an emergency announcer relaying events, ala war of the worlds, keeping track of the monster's growth and movement, as well as reflecting the play tone.\n\nDesign - A full on creature design tool would be a must. Everything from laser beam eyes to grabby tentacles and a slug-like bottom would be available, and your choices would decide how your creature approaches combat. If you went for the pre-made King Kong type, you'd be great at close range and have lots of shielding power, but would have to rely on throwing/jumping attacks for long range. As a tentacled menace, you could pull the city apart with your noodly appendages from a distance - lassoing buildings then ripping them out of their foundations.\n\nMoves - A system similar to the old WCW wrestling games (I haven't played the recent ones) where you can customize your creature's move set to your liking. You could conceivably have a pink Cthulhu doing Capoeira across Manhattan. Who would then Moonwalk into the Empire State Building.\n\nCinema - This would be an option the player can toggle. In cinema mode, you'd have control over the filters (I.E. black and white, film grain, shaky cam, widescreen, slow motion etc) and cameras would be at your disposal on the warpath (during and after you finish the level). These cameras can be CCTV on buildings, cell phone cameras held by panicked citizens (with their own personalized dialog which would mimic your play tone), or helicopters surveying your attack. Once you destroy a camera, you get added points to your total and the camera goes to static. You can then edit the camera angles together (as well as a free cam) to create videos, just like in Driver but on a massive scale.\n\nPoints - You get these for completing levels and causing destruction. They carry over from playthough to playthough, from campaign to campaign, and can be spent on new upgrades for your monster (new moves, new monster types or new cinema options). They're kind of like the tickets you get from an arcade that you get to spend on a shitty plastic toy, only here they can be used to buy FIREBALLS THAT SHOOT OUT OF YOUR SPHINCTER.\n\nMultiplayer - I'll let your imaginations run with the potential here.\n\nI really like this idea, but have no idea how to implement it or where to put it. So here you are, Reddit. Make something of this nonsense.\n\ntl;dr: A game where you can play as any monster from your imagination, tearing the planet apart until you grow so large you kick the earth into the sun. You want to read it now, don't you? Copy and paste this shit, print it out and read it on the John. You will shit yourself reading this.",

And when I open Tor to have hackerman or ufo porno play on the background just cus memes. \n\nEdit: This will activate if the window is active rather than simply if it's opened (Shitty elaboration if you don't know what I mean: It will not play because you opened the app, but because the app is active and you are interacting with it. Meaning, you won't have Tor and your word document overlap because you can only have one active at a time. This is the same as Discord, you can have two games open but it will only show the game that you are clicking and pressing buttons on. The active window is the one you last clicked on usually)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it will take resources, but generally you wouldn't have it detect games, media players, audio/video editors or other things where audio may overlap (it has to be manually).\n\nThis idea sounds so simple, it must be a thing but I can't find anything like it.",

Problem is I need to keep updating the bookmark to reflect my last position on the site or I forget where I left off.\n\nSo what I would like is if there was a special kind of bookmark that would work more like a session than a static link; you could open the site using the bookmark but the link would always point to the last location on the site that you viewed, not the page you originally bookmarked. \nI guess there could be a same domain type restriction where if you navigated away from the domain it would end the session or prompt to end or continue but having to manage that sort of thing manually wouldn't be the worst thing ever.\n\nAnyway that's my idea. Maybe it already exists and I just can't find the right name to search for.",

This allows you to add some troops to your legion or some defences to your castle - annoyingly pillagers have already swarmed your castle twice and taken as much karma as they could carry off but not to worry you still have plenty left and reviewing the security tapes it seems they managed to avoid most your traps and ladder up the west wall - well a pot of boiling oil up there should see them off next time, and one the other side for good measure.\n  \nLet's see, that leaves us enough karma to give our squad of imps all wooden shoes and cloth pants then the archers can have some fire arrows... hmmm, that picture of my cat dressed as link but being called zelda by a dog with a funny look on his face must have just hit 'rising' because a whole bag of karma just turned up and i can afford a human rouge to run with the imps awesome.

The first would be to emulate each comment system on a server, you create a new \"reddit-clone\" account and then verify with your real reddit account with a id number post. That way no one can claim your reddit name. Then youtube or whoever wants to participate puts in a bit of code and voila, decent comments! (And instead, if youtube didn't want to participate, I think the comment system could be inserted by a browser plugin).\r\n\r\nThe other option would be that we set up program where if reddit wanted to part of this system, as soon as the first redditor tried to post a comment, it would automatically create a new reddit submission of the video (all contained in a certain subreddit) and just use the actually reddit comment system instead of emulating it.\r\n",

With my board exams cancelled, and a lot of time on\u00a0my hands, I created\u00a0*CoviCaller -*\u00a0A website made to help solve a critical problem in these pressing times \u2013\u00a0**Fake contacts/duping scams\u00a0offering COVID-19 Resources** **or** **Services in exchange for money.**\n\n[https://www.covicaller.com/](https://www.covicaller.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ga9r5hqpf971.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=13eda0f06929a605df4d766b96018ef3f9a48048\n\nGiven our crumbling healthcare system, it is seen that scammers nowadays prey on the most vulnerable to extort money. Be it COVID-19 patients or their relatives who are in dire need of the resources they claim to offer. They do so by inducing an air of panic, which creates a sense of urgency to buy. This has lead to a loss of massive sums of\u00a0**money**, and even\u00a0**lives**\u00a0in some cases, claim leading news corporations in our country. Post the money transfer, the scammers block the number of the payer and hence become un-traceable. To add to that, there are countless dysfunctional and redundant numbers which upon calling only yield in a\u00a0**waste of time**, which if invested correctly, could have saved a loved one.\n\n***So how do I intend to solve this problem?***\u00a0It\u2019s simple, I take help of good Samaritans in our society (\\*and some JavaScript tutorials\\*)! The website offers two roles:\n\n\u00a01. **Volunteer:**\u00a0 If you have called any number(s) which claimed to offer any COVID-19 services, and they turned out to be a scam or otherwise, you can let the community know by filling out the form on the website. This takes just 3 Minutes, and can help someone save lots of money and, possibly, a life.\n\n2. **User:** You just need to enter the number you wish to verify and all available testimonies for that number open up, which instrumentally help you decide if the contact is credible or not. You can also search for verified numbers by choosing a particular service.\u00a0**And yes, it\u2019s absolutely free**\n\n**What do I do?**\u00a0I just manually verify every number that the volunteers submit on the website and get rid of the spam entries(Not everyone is as full of good intent as you are!) and make sure you don\u2019t face\u00a0**any**\u00a0issues while using the website.\n\n***How is this different from Twitter Scraping or Truecaller?***\n\nThese services have no verification mechanism. Anyone can post any kind of number/data with zero accountability, which defeats the purpose. Also, there is no way for volunteers to add data or testimonies to the database. As the number of entries\u00a0I receive now are limited, I manually verify every number by calling them up and going through the comprehensive parameters in the form data the volunteers fill.\n\n***NOTE: Kindly open*** [***THIS LINK***](https://www.covicaller.com/) ***on your laptop/desktop if possible to get a better experience***\n\nLet me know what you all think about this initiative of mine, and also do share it with your network if you feel this addresses and solves a real problem\n\nHave a great day ahead!\n\n\u00a0\\- [Prabhav Pandey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabhav-pandey-b151a6212/) (18)",

But works for fighting fake news too!\n\nSo when doing a google search, you could select which 'bias' to use (home decor, news, what are crazy trumpist websites saying, tech, etc...) and only see the results you really want.\n\nWould be great if it was something easy to install on possibly \"Qanon suscetible\" relatives' browsers, even if it's just about making it easier to call out each other (\"Really? You added RussiaNews.com to your bias? REALLY?\")",

            "selftext": "I enjoy a good debate. But when people disagree they tend to fall into a range of bad habits that make discussions unproductive. I actually had this problem with one of y oldest friends and we solved it using a chess clock. For those who have not used one this is how it works:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL4xNJOIlDw\n\nBut instead of time to make a move we used the clock to determine both of us had equal time to talk. I see a lot of the same problems in online debates. People talking over each other. People interrupting each other. One person dominating the discussion by simply refusing to stop talking.\n\nSo I would like to see an app or website that used a simple interface based off of the chess clock. Two people would decide a topic and a time allotment. When you are on your time the other person is muted. When you hit your clock you are muted until the other person is done and hits their own clock. If someone's flag falls they are instantly muted and the other person gets to finish their time without rebuttal.\n",

There're also sites which list deeper information for foods. And that it would be a lot easier for me, and others, if this process were automated.\n\nIt should be fairly simple to either reference these values. An import function could be added for a users shopping list(s) and using the dates, it should be relatively simple to show the nutritional intake from that list per day, week, month, etc.\n\nFinally, show the user their RDAs for salt, sugar, carbs, protein, etc and compare that with their estimated consumption via their shopping list, and viola! The user can now see what they're consuming too much of, too little of, etc, and suggestions could be made for each.\n\nAnother obvious use would be to estimate weight gain/loss over a period of time when given some more information on the user (weight, activity level, etc).\n\nI had a quick search but couldn't find anything similar, does something like this exist already?",

            "selftext": "The player begins the game by picking a band name, which can be changed anytime (though a wise player would avoid changing it after the band has already established a significant fanbase). \n\nThe player then recruits musicians to play in the band. A band could have anywhere from 1 to 6 members. Having a greater number of musicians could provide more gameplay possibilities while ramping up the game's complexity (particularly in regard to the band's budget and interpersonal dynamics), so beginning players might want to stick to a band with 3 or 4 members for simplicity's sake.\n\nThe musician recruitment screen could provide a list of, say, 20 or so prospective low-tier musicians with different stats and perks. The musicians would all have first and last names automatically generated from a database, though the player could rename a hired member if so desired.\n\nMusician stats could include things like CHARISMA (with higher ratings leading to better live performances) and ENDURANCE (with higher ratings leading to less fatigue and fewer mishaps while on tour, for example), and perhaps individual ratings for specific instruments (e.g., GUITAR, VOICE, PERCUSSION, KEYS). All stats will fluctuate over time in response to rehearsing, gigging, and other activities and events. \n\nIn addition, musicians could have a list of Perks, such as CONTROL FREAK, ENGINEER, LAZY, CLASSICALLY TRAINED, ADDICT, etc. that could impart specific strengths and weaknesses and trigger unique events or achievements as the game progresses. Most mid-to-high tier musicians will also have a small assortment of gear that will be considered part of the band's inventory, should the player choose to recruit them.\n\nActivities in the game could include the following:\n\n* Rehearsing: The band practices together. The player could choose between jamming (unproductive, but enhances overall skills), songwriting (the band may add an additional song to their repertoire), or preparing for a live set. Each of these options could influence skill development.\n\n* Gigging: The band performs a show consisting of chosen songs, subtly influencing their fanbase and press. The band may be opening for another band or headlining, depending on their notoriety.\n\n* Touring: The band performs a series of shows across multiple locations, dramatically influencing their fanbase, press attention, and fatigue levels.  Again, the band may be opening for another band or headlining.\n\n* Recording: The band records an EP or LP, dramatically influencing their press attention and fatigue levels, and introducing the possibility for downloads/merchandise sales.\n\n* Resting: The band does nothing, improving their fatigue levels.\n\n* Etc.\n\nEvents in the game could include the following:\n\n* A band member may start a side project and ultimately branch off into a different direction\n\n* Two band members may fall into and out of a romantic relationship over the course of several months/years\n\n* One of the band's songs may be used in a movie or TV commercial, dramatically increasing their fanbase while possibly altering their perception among fans and competing bands\n\n* The band's equipment or vehicle may be damaged or stolen during a tour, requiring emergency funds or favors to avoid cancellation\n\n* Etc.\n\nThe player can recruit and fire musicians at will (though not without consequences). In addition, the player may have the option to temporarily hire \"mercenary\" musicians (e.g., session musicians for recording an album, live players for a tour) as well as roadies, promoters, or other support staff for various other activities and events.\n\nAs far as album recording goes, the player will have to choose a producer... or just allow the band to work on the album themselves if they already have the necessary perks and equipment.\n\nThe game could take place in \"turns\" with each turn being either a week or month in the band's existence. While the player is managing his or her band, the computer is simultaneously controlling the actions of other local, regional, and international caliber bands, as well as crunching numbers for gig attendance, record sales, etc... sort of a simulated version of Billboard charts. Also, certain bands that the computer controls may have a positive or negative attitude toward the player's band due to random events and player decisions, which could have a subtle effect on gameplay.\n\nWhile there might be some sort of end-game scenario, the player is basically free to manage their band in a sandbox as he or she sees fit, and hopefully achieve some level of celebrity or infamy.",

            "selftext": "I've seen some videos on YouTube edited so that the speaker is constantly talking. The pauses and \"um\"s and \"ah\"s are edited out making the talks smoother and more engaging in my opinion. As an example, this thorium remix video frequently uses this style of editing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9M__yYbsZ4\n\nAs far as I know, editing videos to remove the pauses and hesitation from talks is a manual process. I believe this could be done algorithmically by analyzing the audio track. So I'm proposing a web-service where I can enter the URL of any YouTube video, for example a TED talk, in order to see a condensed version with the silences removed.\n\nI'm proposing this for YT because I think they have the largest repository of free to watch videos. However, I would also like to see the idea applied to other videos services and podcasts.\n\nI think this principal could be taken even further if YouTube were to open up their analytics data. YouTube analytics keeps track of how many people watch any given second of a video, and it is possible to determine which sections are boring by looking for places where the \"number of users watching\" curve has a steep slope. Videos could be summarized by showing only the moments where the viewer count curve is flat (i.e. where relatively few people stop watching).",

            "selftext": "Idea is as follows:\n\n**Music Rating App/Webpage**\n\n**Abstract:**\nAn application that will randomly select two songs from a playlist. It will repeat playing the two songs until the user decides which song is better. Applying a scoring system, such as the Elo or Glicko, the songs will start to sort your favorite songs and place them at the top of essentially an infinite-star system.\n\n**Reason:** \n5-star and thumbs-up/down systems were nice while your collection was all localized and owning entire albums was the norm. Owning entire albums meant you probably owned songs you didn\u2019t like, or ever even care to listen to. You didn\u2019t want to delete them because you owned them, so they earned a 1-star. Today streaming music is the norm. Why place songs you don\u2019t like into your playlists? Every song you choose to put into a playlist is a song you like.\n\n**Time/Mood:**\nWhile I realize rating all of your songs into a perfect \u2018best\u2019 to \u2018least-best\u2019 list will take time, and rating a song over another will depend on your current mood. After enough time rating your songs, it will eventually be \u2018normalized\u2019 or at least be \u2018close enough\u2019.\n\n**Close enough:**\nWhat does \u2018close enough\u2019 even provide? Endless possibilities and options. Among all these possibilities, you will be able to determine your favorite band/artist, create a new playlist of 25 songs from the top 25 different artists, etc. You plan to introduce your friend to a new artist? Let it create a playlist that features all of your favorite songs from that artist with the rule that it must not exceed 45 mins total. Want to see your friends top 100 list? Export a playlist, as long as they opted to share their data publicly, or with their friends.\n\n**Rate modes:**\nPreference on how you would like to compare songs will vary greatly among users. While \u2018Rate Mode\u2019 is turned on, you might have the option to play both songs over and over again until you declare a winner (or a tie). You might prefer a \u2018Snippet Mode\u2019 where it only plays the first 30 seconds, or the very middle most 60 seconds, or play 1/5th of the song starting at 3/10ths of the way into the song, you decide exactly how you want it to run. Maybe you already know your music well enough and you need to expedite your song rating experience, choose to use the \u2018Expedite Mode\u2019 which will just display the song comparison in text, all the while you are listening to music in the background. Other customizable options may include prioritizing an artist by forcing the artist to appear in the comparison for [insert a percent or fraction] of the time, for the next [insert time or number of songs], moving a song up or down [insert number] spots on your list or focus your efforts on the top [insert number or percent] of your songs..\n\n\n**Play modes:**\nWhile it is nice to be able to create a bunch of playlists on the fly from the data you have collected, but you aren\u2019t going to want to create a playlist every time you decide to listen to your top 100 songs, etc. In \u2018Play Mode\u2019, with many user determined rules, you would be able to select what range of songs, or which artists or what genre of songs to play. This mode will be more for the listener, where exporting playlists will be great for sharing with others.\n\n**Social/Discovery:**\nWith all the data collected, it would be very simple to determine music compatibility with others. Example, \u2018You share 9 of your 10 same top favorite groups as this person, explore their music,\u2019 \u2018You and this person have 40 of your top 50 songs in common, find out what else this person likes.\u2019 While social aspects are not for everyone, it still will be a good way to explore new music. You will be able to search through those peoples music tastes, those who have decided to \u2018go public\u2019 with their data, all the while you remain in \u2018private mode\u2019.\n\n**How:**\nI really don\u2019t care how this application is created, just as long as it happens. I envision a completely new program or website that is separate from anything else out there. It might be a website that also includes an app on Spotify. As I am not a developer I have no idea what will be best, thats where all of you come in.\n\n**Summary:**\nA highly user customizable application that would organize itself into a \u2018best\u2019 to \u2018least best\u2019 list of songs based solely upon the user\u2019s song comparison choices over time. This app would supplement the current music streaming era with great fun and even greater automated functionality that just seems necessary for this time.\n\n**TL;DR:** See Summary.\n",

It's a tournament app for your music library. The app could take however many tunes from your library (the number could be configurable by the user, maybe) and create a tournament bracket out of them. You could seed the entries by play count/skip count, so strong entries play weak entries early in the contest.\n> The app would show you the whole bracket, then zoom in to the top left and would play five seconds from one song then five seconds from another. The user would then pick which he liked better; whether he does it based on his opinion of the song or the opinion of the clip is up to him, but he decides who \"advances\" to the next round. The bracket gets smaller and smaller, and when the game is done the winning track is automatically added to a playlist in iTunes.\n> This would definitely get me to listen to the music I sometimes forget about in my library and would be an easy way to kill five minutes in line at the bank or something. Definitely something I'd be on board with.\n\nThere has been this attempt here:http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=56908\n\nBut it is lacking in a few features that have been suggested, and any attempts to reach the original developer has failed.

            "selftext": "What I think would be really awesome is the following: a game where you can drive a car anywhere in the world. The basic idea would be to take Google Maps/Earth data as the input, in real time, and then map that 2D map to a 3D world that you could freely explore. You would type in an address, and then just go there, and start driving, and it would kind of look like that place. As you drive, in the background, the program grabs more data from the surrounding areas and starts to build the in-game representation of the real world.\n\nPossible other ideas would be to grab and use geotagged photos and other data, in real time, to render the world in more detail. Obviously, the game world couldn't look exactly as it does in real life, but I think it would be possible to use random building models,  landscape textures, topography info and the satellite images to at least get something of the feeling for most areas, especially given that the exact street configurations would be known from the maps. Any info with lat/long coordinates could potentially be used for the game world, for example photos from flickr or info from Wikimapia.\n\nThe game could be purely a sim, or potentially used as a base for other typical driving game activities, i.e. races around the streets, or even GTA-style missions. There could be simulated traffic, pedestrians, etc. The current local weather/time could be incorporated, if desired.\n\nSo, the basic concept is: a 3D driving game in a facsimile of the real world, generated by grabbing maps and other data off the web in real time. Thoughts? Presumably there are open source driving games out there, which could be used as a starting point and allow developers to focus on creating the world from available data.",

With this problem I came across the solution of solar powered IOT livestock tracker, problem is that most suppliers operate in the Western hemisphere (US,Australia, New Zealand) and are not looking to expand to international markets for now. Given this there is an opportunity to do an app for this I have already identified a hardware supplier but have no technical skills for the app development part.

If there are any Additional Guests I enter in that number below in the next box. The Day and Room will be a drop-down as it's always the same, and Number of Guests can as well if it's easier. Once they plug in that information, the program will calculate the Price (before sales tax), and also have the Price with Tax included below.\n\nFor **Monday - Thursday**, the base price and price with tax will be the same: $99.00 and there will be no tax charged. If there are Additional Guests that needs to be added, it will be $20.00/person.\n\nThe tricky part here is this:\n\nFor **Friday - Sunday** the prices change based on the Room chosen and Number of Guests entered. A tax of 7% should always be charged for these days.\n\nIf they choose/type 1-3 in the Number of Guests box, the base will be $99, but it will charge the tax and show that pricing in the box that includes tax. If they choose/type 4-8 people then the pricing becomes $28.00/person.\n\nBut now depending on which room they choose and the number of guests entered, the program should calculate a 20% discount automatically:\n\nIf I choose Room 1, I should only be able to choose up to 6 people, and the program should calculate a discount of 20% only if I have 5-6 people entered into the box. For Rooms 2 and 3, it should only go up to 8 people, and the program should only calculate a discount of 20% if I have 7-8 people entered.\n\nNow if I need to add additional guests in that box, the pricing should be $22.40/person, instead of $28.00/person, as the program should already be adding the 20% discount.\n\nPlease let me know how easy/hard this actually is, and if this is something that may be better just doing in an Excel sheet and plugging in the information into the cells.\n\nEdit: I know it\u2019s a bit confusing to understand, so hopefully [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/jsh0sh/smt_price_calculator/gc0f74f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) post clears it up a bit!",

The local news doesn't tell us \"hey go out and watch this\" like they do with meteor showers and stuff.\n\n It would just be cool to have some advanced warning and be able to photograph and video it.\n\n So I'd like an app that alerts when there's going to be a rocket launch within 24 hours (and whatever variable options you want to add. If anybody needs ideas, I have a ton of them for this particular app idea, into the minutia) \n\nEven if people aren't local, they'd still like the chance to find a livestream online to watch a launch I'm sure.. \n\nYou could even go the extra mile and link to the live streams for the launches within the app. \n\nThe launch schedules are made public well in advance. Sometimes they scrub or postpone the launch, you would have to update with alerts for that as well, but no biggie. \n\nYou could link to news articles explaining the reason for the scrubbed or postponed launch. \n\nYou could even have a news tab for articles about the upcoming launches and similar relevant space program news.\n\n\nBasically similar to what the earthquake alert app does. :3!",

Also, spawned on 1-2 means favoring turning, 3-4 = walking straight, for a total of 4 easy AIs. They die if they are shot or walk out of the mile radius, and they match your walking pace.\n\nThe first item is a pistol. You have a trigger button, and it will destroy a zombie directly down the street you're on or closest to. One bullet each.\n\nScore = steps taken since start + 25 per dead zombie.\n\nPerhaps to simplify further, we try making it with a controller and premade map and then try making a map from G-maps then add gps control. \n\n---\n  \nZombies should wind up having a few strategies, similar to Pacman 256. You know, some that are fast but can't find you easily, some that are slow but do track you, that sort of thing. \n\nThere should also be 3 types of items: Tower bases that can be placed on the side of a road, powerups that can be used in-hand or on a turret, and some kind of energy/currency like PacDots or Ingress XM.  The powerups would have a very strong but short ability when used in-hand, and a perpetual but somewhat weak effect when used in a turret. Back to the pistol, in-hand would be an insta-kill while giving it to a turret would be a low-power but recharging weapon that could fight off multiple zombies. Also, the turrets would get an upgrade tree, like Bloons TD5, each upgrade costing another power of the same type and some of the currency.",

Whenever i wake up by alarm or something other than natural arising, I have intense nausea for about an hour or 2.  In this time, eating breakfast is impossible.  i literally gag as if im going to throw up for the first 45 minutes or so im awake.  \n\nWhen im free to wake up naturally, the nausea is far less intense, and i can basically eat about half an hour or so after waking. \n\ninterestingly, drinking helps.  booze, that is.  waking up after a night of drinking is generally much easier and doesn't include the nausea.\n\ni've had the nausea problem much longer than i've been a heavy drinker, so i don't think the drinking is causing the nausea.  \n\nanyway, from running through the comments, it seems people think it might have something to do with waking up in the middle of a REM cycle.  so, someone should make an app or some standalone device that adjusts the wake-up time of the alarm to align with when you should naturally rise.

            "selftext": "I have long been fascinated by genetic algorithms and their ability to find optimal solutions that humans would not instinctively attempt (e.g. [radio antennae](http://bit.ly/duIUA6) that look quite odd, but are optimal).\n\nI also think that modern computing architectures are reaching a point where systems engineers are \"guessing\" as to what is optimal (have you seen how many instructions are available on a modern chip? How can anybody know the optimal way to handle all of that junk?). As a result it may be that solutions we would not attempt are in fact more optimal. \n\nI also think there is the possibility to use other components within a machine (video card is one being used already, FPGAs less so but with massive potential) to produce dramatically better performance either in terms of clock time, memory management or other performance factors we're interested in, but no compiler designer would be able to reasonably factor in when designing a compiler.\n\nWhat I propose is a compiler where we can provide several seeds of how an operation could be conducted. A very trivial example:\n\na = b * c\n\nWe need to explain this is:\n\n* An assignment (that must always happen)\n* We can do the assignment on the result of the processor's machine code for multiplication (b MULTI c)\n* We can do the result of the processor's machine code for addition (LOOP c times: b + b)\n* We can do the addition trick on c, looping b times\n* We can do this in many different ways using different registers\n* We can do all the above but farm it off to a graphics card\n* If an FPGA is around, farm it off to there by using some VHDL\n* Heck, if we've got access to a cloud or a supercompute cluster there is a load of code here to do it over there\n* Depending on context, you might want to change which registers or techniques are used by other components executed before we get here\n* And so on...\n\nYou build up these building blocks of basic operations and more complex ones (including code to sending it off somewhere remotely).\n\nSometimes I'll want to say \"if this cluster of code takes more than x time to process, consider a mutation where it's sent off to a remote instance\", or whatever, but not have it try it for everything\n\nAt compile time I tell it which architectures I want to use (so can disable FPGA, cloud computing, graphic card use), and say \"I want an optimal version of this program I have written in C/C++/Ruby/whatever producing for this architecture\"\n\nThe compiler goes through multiple mutations based on the set of different ways of achieving the same goal at an atomic level we have described, looking for the \"best score\" based on what we care about when setting flags: performance, memory usage, cost, etc.\n\nEach generation is benchmarked and so we do this not for things like \"find me the optimal way to add two numbers\", but for non-trivial scenarios like a kernel or major piece of infrastructure.\n\nEventually we get something we can execute on that architecture that is optimal according to the constraints we set: things are faster or more efficient than they would have been using a traditional multiple-pass compiler.\n\nThis has the further bonus that we don't care as much about the quality of the code going in with regards to optimization. Obviously good code written with performance goals in mind will likely score close to our optimal result in fewer generations (do we want to put known \"bad\" instruction sets in our seed algorithms to see where they mutate?), but bad code will eventually get mutated into more optimal code that is functionally - at a higher level of abstraction - identical to what the programmer intended.\n\nObviously buggy code will produce a buggy result, but if we have great test coverage and the software is \"release candidate\", part of the release procedure would be to go through the GA compiler to find the optimal compiled binary for a target infrastructure, or more likely release engineers would produce multiple versions, (possibly that could be used to \"breed\" better versions), or if open source the end-user would be able to state what they care about.\n\nThere are of course constraints we'd have to worry about in future iterations: a mutation that is optimal in one environment might behave very differently if the kernel has to context switch more because in the real world it's in a \"busier\" environment, for example. That's a problem left for another day... :-)\n\nI'm discussing this in terms of general software compilation, but of course initially it would have most use in specific domains: scientific models, \"expensive\" system calls on machines that need to be optimal, systems that mutate to be more fault-tolerant of hardware failure for safety-critical systems, etc.\n\nIt's not a small project, but might make for an interesting PhD thesis I'll never write, and curious as to whether others think it has any merit.",

Only bars and numbers on screen, which functionally makes it hardly better than the command-line utilities `dd` and `ddrescue` for benchmarking, only more *eye-candy*.\n\nThere is also \"QpxTool\", but that is only for optical media, like Nero DiscSpeed for Windows.\n\n----\n## Problems with Gnome Disks's integrated benchmarking tool:\n\n* Doesn't remember my parameter settings, but instead always goes back to default, which includes enabled writing benchmark, which I usually **do not** wish to use.\n* Only works on mounted partitions, not whole devices\n* As already mentioned, it has no full sequential mode, only *number of samples* and *size per sample*, where it either skips large portions or scans some on-disk locations redundantly.\n* Lacks the ability to start at an offset, but can only start at the beginning.\n* Lacks the ability to pause, so I can temporarily use the full transfer rate of the device without thereafter having to start the benchmark all over again.\n* Lacks the ability to set block size. Not all devices support the default 512-byte block transfers.\n\nLast time I checked, HDDScan has all these features except the first two.",

For example one not having a good purple or pink, or one not having a good beige tone. I was thinking to myself \"is it possible to have a quantized palette that covers (a.k.a. is equally good at representing) every color that a human can perceive\"? Of course, if you check RGB values and make 16 permutations of those from 000000 to FFFFFF, it's gonna look icky because humans are better at perceiving some colors than others (if you'll notice, the RGB colors seem to go in this brightness order - yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, blue - although according to the system they have the same hue) (and also note that a \"light cyan\" is less perceptually different from the main color than a \"light red\" in RGB), so I couldn't trust that to adequately represent human vision. Well, I found out about CIE L.a.b. color space, and how with the CE Delta 2000 standard, the color system is set to be \"globally perceptually uniform\" - that is, \"light blue\" is as different from blue to the eye as \"light yellow\" is different from yellow, because it's designed to match how humans percieve colors to be \"different\".\n\nI've tried googling this, but some of the solutions seemed random (using k-means, which have a random element, to distill the full CIE color space), not want I wanted (IWantHue's modern version, whose results don't include pure black or white), hard to use (such as raw java or python scripts which I'm not sure how to run with variables such as \"give me 16 colors\"), or glitchy (I tried using IWantHue's old version and Phrogz, but they stopped responding once I entered my input), so I need someone who is a tech whiz or knows how to figure this out.\nThe palette I'm looking for is:\n\n1. Able to cover all human perceptual colors (so it needs black or white)...\n\n2. To the point that a 16-color palette can (so basically, the 16 values would be the smallest possible perceptual difference from any color on Earth without compromising another color's difference). Global perceptual uniformity is what I think this is?)\n\n3. According to human perception (so it is NOT designed in RGB, which is designed to be computer instructions for rendering colors to a screen, although it is output to RGB) (CIE L.a.b color space and CIE Delta 2000 appear to make this true)\n\n4. Computed (I have made handmade palettes before, but like I said, I am looking for the palette that can, according to math, represent any perceptible color equally well to the eye, and my judgement is obviously flawed)\n\nHere is something that seems similar, but the algorithms aren't given, so I can't be sure if this is what I was thinking.http://prestopnik.com/warfish/colors/http://hackerspace.kinja.com/some-os-x-calendar-tips-1658107833/1665644975\n\nAlso, here are those libraries that I wasn't able to send input to:\n\nhttps://github.com/federicospini/unique-colors\n\nI'll update if I can find the Java one, sorry.\n\nI'm sorry for the huge question and very scientific request. I just thought it would be cool for there to be a \"universal crayon box\" for things like graphic design and game art where the \"most important\" colors are finally computed.",

Something along the lines of Age of Empires mixed with Armymen 2 3DO.\n\nYou start as a lone wolf outlaw.  Someone you had a run in with has been taken to jail.  Your first mission is to get him out using your guns and taking out the crooked cops (tutorial or something).  After the marshals are relieved, the mission is over, and the cut scene is you unlocking the jail cell freeing two other outlaws.  From then on, they ride with you throughout the game.\n\nThe game has multiple levels, maybe 10 or so.  You fight off wild animals, other cowboys, outlaw gangs, get in gun fights, and maybe native americans if it isn't too offensive.  As the game goes on, your posse grows bigger and bigger until you have around 30 or so gang members.  \n\nI think something like this would be a blast and I hope to see someone make this cause I'd play the shit out of it!",

Adding up all the goods and dividing by three doesn't work and none of us wants to pay for everything and wait for the other two to pay up their share.\n\nSo I came up with an idea for an application that allows one to input the item and its price, adds up the items, and would divide up the items almost equally into three portions. So I would pay for the plungers, dishes, etc, another person would be for whatever, and the last person would pay for his share. And all of us would have paid roughly the same amount.\n\nEDIT: A BIG thanks to /u/rlee0001 for creating this tool here: http://jsfiddle.net/zpgH2/12/",

            "selftext": "First off you could and should keep the old school graphics. Maybe make slight improvements but basically a lot of lines. The thing that makes it is that it's and an MMO and that there is absolutely no AI.\n\nThere are two teams each with their own planet at opposite sides of the board (potentially you could expand to support multiple teams later on). \n\nMissile Command Part:\n\nWhen you first start you are assigned to a missile turret. Your job is to defend the bases next to your turret. (Duh) Pilots from the opposing planet are trying to destroy your planet either by bombing or with kamikaze attacks (though a kamikaze attack would send them back to the beginning). If you survive without losing either your turret or your designated bases for a set amount of time you graduate in rank from turret operator to pilot. In this set amount of time you may be able to earn power-ups based on the number of pilots you take down or how long you play (if you defer the promotion).\n\nAsteroid Part:\n\nIn the middle of the two planets is an asteroid belt. As a pilot you are not only trying to destroy asteroids so your other pilots can get through, but also battle on coming pilots. \n\nThere could also be a tower defense aspect. You could capture asteroids and either build improvements on them (gun turrets, tractor beams that would make them \"heat-seeking\", mines to allow bases on the planet to be rebuilt, or atomic bombs which make the asteroids into huge mines). These would continue to exist (flying from one edge of the board to the other indefinitely) until they crashed into a pilot or where shot down. Again, you'd accrue these upgrades based on kills or time on the board.\n\nThe ultimate power ups would be the ability to generate worm holes or warp. Worm holes would act like one way portals where anything can pass through them (put the start worm hole in the asteroid belt and the other right next to your opponents planet so they were bombarded with asteroids). Warping would require a great deal of energy which would only charge so quickly, but allow you to instantly appear anywhere on the board you chose.\n\nSO there it is. I feel like the graphics and mechanics wouldn't be too hard. This is just basically a bigger version of games that existed in the 80's. But the MMO part would be what made it so addicting. The legend board would show the user with the all-time most kills, all-time longest survive rates, etc. Also more upgrades could be added later. \n\nI've never played Farmville or anything, but I think you could tie this into Facebook and get a huge following. I waive all rights to this idea, I just want a fun game to play at work.",

If you tell it that, it wouldn't suggest that food again for a certain amount of time.\n\nMost people wouldn't be able to stick to exactly what it said all of the time, so you should be able to tell it when you didn't do what it said and have it adjust for you. There should also be a snack button that the user pushes when he or she wants a snack. The system would take into account what has been eaten recently, what is planned to be eaten in the future, and then tell you the optimal snack.\n\nThere should be a page that tells you what you will need to buy to be able to stick to the plan for an amount of time that you specify. It would tell you ingredients you will need and the like. Maybe it could eventually even link to an amazon shopping cart or something where you can buy it all instantly and have it delivered. \n\nThis system would remove any hassle from eating healthily. It wouldn't be too strict because it would adjust to what you do. It would eventually learn exactly what you like and dislike. Shopping for groceries would be very easy. A lot of people don't want to have to think about what they eat. Currently, that means that they are probably not eating healthily. This system could change that and remove any difficulty from eating healthily. ",

Mens' and Woman's fashion.   \n\nEssentially a user would create an account, which would then allow them to begin building their \"wardrobe\".  They could search by designer, and then by year, line, style, etc. to find the piece they own.  Then they would add it to their wardrobe.  \nIn the case of vintage items, things not found online, etc. the user could be prompted to upload a picture of the item and supply relevant tagging information.  \n\nA bunch of useful tools could then be built around a user's wardrobe.  Off the top of my head I can think of things like outfit creation - the user uses a color wheel to pick a few colors they want to base an outfit off of, and the website pulls color data from wardrobe pictures and adds into it some basic fashion rules and such before returning a generated outfit of pieces the user owns.  \nAdditionally, the user could create outfits him/herself and save them.  \n\nAnother tool could of course be shopping - buttons for _Find Similar Items_, _Find More from Designer_, etc. would be quick links to relevant designer's sites, shopping sites, etc. or the site itself could have a shopping area.  \n\nUsers could make and follow friends - they would get updates when friends add new items to their wardrobe and even recommend clothes to them.  Communities could start secondhand shops and trade services.\n\nWhat do you think?  Is it do-able?  Does it already exist (with men's fashion too)?  I'd love to see it made if it doesn't.  Revenue would be possible too through shopping and such.  Maybe a premium user scheme?\n\n\nEDIT: Existing sites such as ClosetCouture, PolyVore, Shmotter, and ClosetBank don't fit the idea since they are either not unisex, or not a finished highly useable product.\n",

I don't know coding so this could be easy to do but I have no clue weather it is or not. Some use cases:\n\nArt: have an account following varying artists/photographers. The frame could then cycle every 10/15/30/60 seconds throughout those accounts backlogs and randomly display them.\n\nFriends: have an account following friends, family, or anything you just want to keep up with. Would cycle in chronological order newest to oldest, and reset to the start with newest posts/ newly posted pics once it reaches posts older than 24/48 hours\n\nMemes: combo of friends and art, just shoves Instagram memes in your face, but they're always fresh.\n\n-\n\nTap functionalities: if the frame is touchscreen, you could add possible tap commands. Here's the idea I had for it:\n\n1 tap: caption & account, would show the account name and caption for that post\n\n2 taps: likes the photo\n\n3 taps: the frame cycles through pictures posted only by that account\n\n4 taps: I don't know the actual capabilities of smart frames, but it would be cool if it sent you an Instagram message with a link or a notification to your phone that takes you to that account so you could pull it up on your phone and scroll through it there\n\nJust something that's been rattling around in my head. Just just be cool to have a \"picture frame\" on your wall scrolling through pictures throughout your day, and would be great for people who like art and would want to display it in their house, but would like it to be current/new art from artists that might not have physical art available.",

I finished it last week and it now live on the App store. I tested this with a few beta testers here on reddit and have received quite a lot of good feedback.\n\nI built MoodWell - a mood tracker app which I have been using for last month. Would love feedback on this!\n\nApp Store link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moodwell-mood-tracker-diary/id1443436795?ls=1&mt=8\n\n**Screenshots:**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/3QTp4PY\n\n**Description:**\n\nMoodWell mood tracker enables you to keep a private journal of how different activities and changes in weather effect your mental health. Use this super-simple to use diary to know which activities make you feel your absolute best and which ones might be negatively impacting you.\n\nWe recommend logging your mood at least once but preferably 2-3 times a day. You should at least log any drastic changes in your mood and factors which make you feel that way. \n\nChoose from a list of color coded moods and attach optional positive or negative emotions you might be feeling. Add activities on what you have been up to. Describe the weather if you like. You can also add photos and notes to the logs. \n\nMoodWell uses the recorded moods, activities and weather data to present interesting statistics on your mental health. The graphs and calendar show how your mood changes over a period of time. After logging a few times, you will get valuable insights like - which weekdays do you usually feel your best, which ones are the worst, which months of the year are your best and worst, which activities you do more often when you feel good and which ones make you feel not too good. Are you usually in a worse mood when it's cold and gloomy outside? Are you more energetic when it's sunny?\n\nThe color coded Year in Pixels chart shows you how you have felt on every single day throughout the year similar to an old school diary.\n\nThese insights will help you understand your mental health better. You can also use the search function to look for specific items - hastags can be used to make the search super powerful. For example:\n\n    #n will search for all logs with notes\n    #p will search for all logs with photos\n    #awful will search for all logs with awful mood\n    #exercise will search for all days when you worked out\n    #sunny will search for all days when it was sunny\n\nMoodWell comes with:\n\n- biometric (TouchID or FaceID) authentication to make your app private so only you can unlock it\n- ability to create custom activities, emotions, weather tags\n- attach photos\n- attach notes \n- daily, weekly, monthly and yearly charts\n- reminders to never forgot to log\n- export all your data to open in Excel\n- a new background everyday to keep the app looking fresh\n- 30 Free and fully featured logs after which we hope you will buy a one-time small in app purchase to support future updates development and unlock unlimited logs\n\nHappy journaling!\n\nPlease let me know if you have any feedback! I am working on an update for UI updates and improvements and would love to hear how I can make it better! \n\nHere's a few promo codes for the in app purchase. If you use one, please comment below which number you used so others can skip those! Thank you!\n\n1. KN737Y4K9NYM\n2. MH7TF73TA9K3\n3. E6KLHR6K9XMT\n4. X6KWPRH9AM73\n5.

            "selftext": "# Motivation\n\nImagine a painting of epic proportions. You take few steps back to see it all. The details fade but the whole picture becomes clear, magnificent, harmonious. You come back closer and notice new details. More and more is revealed the closer you get until you are almost touching the painting with your nose. You could spend weeks exploring it wondering how many decades it took to create this.\n\nThere are huge open source software projects which are created by armies of programmers working over multiple years out of their own interest. What would happen if artists could collaborate on such a scale? Collaborative art already exists online but I think it lacks certain tools to really flourish. I would like to describe such a tool below.\n\n# Idea\n\nAn online platform for artists which has the following features.\n\n* **Paint/draw/photoshop/animate(?)**. Artists use an (online) image editor with some advanced features such as layers.\n* **Fork.** Artist can make a copy somebody else's (incomplete) painting and make an edit to it. The edited copy can in turn itself be copied. Repeating this process creates a tree of copies.\n* **Merge**. Multiple people may copy the same (incomplete) painting and make different edits independently of each other. When somebody merges two versions of a painting from different branches all edits making them up since their common ancestor are applied on the same canvas. Some additional work such as re-ordering and re-positioning of the layers may be required to create a harmonious outcome.\n* **Stars**. Some artists would be consistently working on a painting making frequent edits and merging contributions to their copy from smaller artists. This painting will have higher quality and popularity which will be reflected by the number of stars people give it.\n* **Merge request**. If you want to make an edit to a painting, you can fork it, make the edit and requests the \"owner\" of the original to accept your edit. If the \"owner\" is too strict or has abandoned the painting, you can \"take over\" by merging the edits of others in to your own copy.\n* **Hierarchy**. If the painting becomes so huge that no single person has time to review all merge requests the responsibilities can be split. One artists can be in charge of one part of the painting (e.g. top left quadrant, or the background layer, or lighting) merging edits which relate to that part and pushing the combined result to his \"superior\".",

You open Yelp or Google Maps and you find 5 cafes in the area. \n\nWe've all been there. So what? \n\nWhat if you could inject your casual purchases with a sense of vindictive pleasure? As the internet oozes over boycott hashtags the reality is grim. Without engaged, sustained interest in a strike consumer leverage is lost. How to hold attention? Anyone born after 1981 can tell you - make it a game.\n\nAn application that is part Fit Bit and part Dodgeball but with less corniness and a bit more irreverent, anarchic fun. For example, let's say Abe's coffee's CEO publicly supports Donald Trump, and Benny's coffee has promised to raise their minimum wage to spite the President (hypotheticals, chill). What if you can make a purchase at Benny's coffee and see a visualization on your phone of the money that DIDN'T go to the Trump family because of your economic choice? \n\nThe game would represent costs and gains for the Trump family business with points. The more a user shops at corporations publicly aligned against the Trump Family business the more points the user accumulates. Geo-specific leader boards could create site specific competition like Pokemon Go.  Head-to-head or group battle options could mimic the competitive dynamic of a Fantasy Football matchup. Points are, essentially, representatives for dollar amounts spent at \"preferable\" companies. However, presenting the points as \"attack points\" against the Trump family business creates a game scenario that's more fun than simply tracking spending. \n\nIt's also social, which is pretty key to any sustained collective action, no?\n\nWith a fun interface reminiscent of the game Rampage, for example, the Bump Trump (working title, obvs) game has the potential to bring like-minded consumers together through patriotic spirit while also fomenting business. It's good for the left and it's good for the right. Everyone wins! \n\nWhat do you all think?\n",

It sounds simple to me. It could be a universal flagging utility, like a left-click on a word, that would simply send a flag to the publisher attached to the particular word. If the publisher, say, gets 800 feedback flags on a particular word in an article, they would immediately know there is an error and the writer or editor could go back to the article and correct it in real time.

            "selftext": "The problem I have with current stopwatch apps is one of three things.\n\nA. The buttons are so small I have to focus on my screen instead of the thing I want to time, giving me slightly incorrect results or risk missing the button.\n\nB. The buttons are big enough but the app isn't fully featured; i.e. it doesn't have a lap feature.\n\nC. It looks really bad, like its made by someone who doesn't know how to design.\n\n---\n\nWhat I suggest is a fully featured stopwatch app that has buttons big enough that you know your pressing them even when your not focused on the screen. \n\nBut how?\n\n[Mockups Here!](http://imgur.com/a/cFGDv#0)\n-\n\nYou would be able to scroll the times on the right and click on the top right corner to get a better view (shown on the third and fourth mockup slide).\n\nTapping the top right would also give you more options. Like average. \n\n---\n\nThings You could also add (later)\n-\n\n- Swiping left on the lap times (like a second page) would give you even more details like mean, median, mode, charts, graphs, email options.\n\n- Settings would also be on that page; things like playing a sound when you press start/stop/lap/reset and when you tap the center time it copies it to clipboard.\n\n- The apps main priority would be fast loading, because whenever I want to time something, I generally don't have time to wait on a really slow app to load.\n\n- If I were to name it I would call it \"stopwatcher\" because calling it \"stopwatch [blank]\" is too generic.\n",
